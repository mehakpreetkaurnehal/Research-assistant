Abstract
Recent advances in computational pathology have lever-
aged vision–language models to learn joint representations
of Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) images with spatial tran-
scriptomic (ST) profiles. However, existing approaches typ-
ically align HE tiles with their corresponding ST profiles at
a single scale, overlooking fine-grained cellular structures
and their spatial organization. To address this, we propose
SIGMMA, a multi-modal contrastive alignment framework
for learning hierarchical representations of HE images and
spatial transcriptome profiles across multiple scales. SIG-
MMA introduces multi-scale contrastive alignment, ensur-
ing that representations learned at different scales remain
coherent across modalities. Furthermore, by representing
cell interactions as a graph and integrating inter- and intra-
subgraph relationships, our approach effectively captures
cell–cell interactions, ranging from fine to coarse, within
the tissue microenvironment. We demonstrate that SIGMMA
learns representations that better capture cross-modal cor-
respondences, leading to an improvement of avg. 9.78% in
the gene-expression prediction task and avg. 26.93% in the
cross-modal retrieval task across datasets. We further show
that it learns meaningful multi-tissue organization in down-
stream analyses.

macroscopic structures, e.g., tertiary lymphoid structures
[36].
Understanding these hierarchical contexts requires
both morphological and molecular views of tissue.
Computational histopathology has been advanced by
large-scale analysis of cellular morphology, tissue composi-
tion, and spatial organization, most commonly Hematoxylin
Eosin (HE) images. In parallel, single-cell spatial transcrip-
tomics (ST) enables the molecular profiling of individual
cells with 2D spatial coordinates, providing direct links be-
tween morphology and gene expression profiles. Together,
these technologies allow researchers to map how individ-
ual cell types, cell-cell interactions, and spatial organiza-
tion of cells contribute to physiological and pathological
processes [43]. Multi-modal learning of HE images with
ST profiles provides a unified representation of tissue mor-
phology and molecular state, enabling the identification of
molecular heterogeneity that is not discernible from HE im-
ages alone (Fig. 1c).
Why do we need a graph structure for ST modeling?
Recent contrastive learning approaches learn joint repre-
sentations of HE images and ST in a shared space to
support cross-modal tasks, including image-to-expression
retrieval and image-to-expression prediction.
Notably,
vision–language (VL) models originally developed for
HE–biomedical text (e.g., caption, scientific papers, clini-
cal notes) have been adapted for ST [8, 13, 44]. However,
current VL-based HE–ST contrastive alignment approaches
represent ST as a 1D gene sequence aggregated across cells
[8, 13, 44], thereby inevitably discarding the original 2D
spatial organization and cell–cell interactions within the tis-
sue (Fig. 1a, bottom). In contrast, graph representations
inherently encode spatial topology and relational structure,
enabling explicit modeling of cell–cell interactions and the
surrounding tissue context (Fig. 1b bottom).
Why do we need hierarchical multi-scale HE-ST con-
trastive alignment?
The hierarchical organization of tis-
sue makes multi-scale HE–ST alignment inherently chal-
lenging.
Multi-scale alignment implicitly requires cor-
respondence across region-of-interest (ROI) granularities.
Embeddings learned from contrastive loss (e.g., InfoNCE
loss) maximize the lower bound of mutual information be-
tween two pairs [28], which tends to emphasize salient fea-
tures at the expense of finer details [42]. Specifically, graph-
structured ST data complicates multi-scale alignment be-
cause message passing expands the receptive field based on
graph connectivity rather than image ROI scales, leading to
mismatched spatial scopes across modalities. To overcome
this limitation, multi-scale contrast alignment methods in-
corporate multiple ROI sizes, thus capturing both coarse-
and fine-grained tissue features. (Fig. 1b).
Our contribution.
We propose SIGMMA, a hierarchical,
graph-based, multi-scale alignment framework for HE–ST.
• Graph-structured representation of ST. We represent
ST as a cell graph that preserves spatial topology and the
structure of cell-cell relationships. A hierarchical graph
module integrates intra- and inter-subgraph relationships
to capture local neighborhoods and long-range dependen-
cies that are lost in sequence-based ST representations.
• Multi-scale cross-modal alignment.
We introduce a
multi-scale HE–ST alignment framework that enforces
alignment consistency across multiple spatial resolutions.
Our multi-scale contrastive objective aligns representa-
tions from micro, meso, and macro contexts, improving
fine-grained and coarse-grained correspondence.
• ST graph–HE image scale reconciliation. We progres-
sively expand the graph receptive field through hierarchi-
cal graph learning, matching it to the image ROI size and
enabling consistent correspondence between modalities
across scales.
• Performance improvements and interpretability. SIG-
MMA yields improvements in downstream tasks, includ-
ing gene-expression prediction and image–expression re-
trieval, across five datasets and produces embeddings that
reveal biologically meaningful tissue organization.
2. Related Work
ST at single-cell resolution.
ST has emerged as a pow-
erful approach to map gene expression within the spatial
context of tissues. Specifically, it measures gene expression
together with 2D spatial coordinates, indicating the location
and level of expression of specific genes. There are two
main techniques for measuring ST: Visium [39] and Xe-
nium [21]. Visium is a sequencing-based platform which
captures transcriptomic signals at the spot level, where each
spot typically aggregates the expression profiles of multiple
neighboring cells. In contrast, the Xenium platform utilizes
high-resolution in situ hybridization and imaging to mea-
sure gene expression at the cellular/subcellular levels, of-
fering deeper insights into cell–cell interactions.
In this work, we use Xenium rather than Visium be-
cause Xenium provides cell-level spatial transcriptomics,
enabling alignment with HE images while explicitly mod-
eling each cell’s 2D spatial context.
Tiling of HE WSI image.
Whole-slide images (WSIs)
are gigapixel-scale, making direct application of vision
models computationally prohibitive and forcing heavy
down-sampling that removes critical cellular-level signals
[18]. Since discriminative patterns are small, sparse, and
spatially scattered, tile-level modeling enables vision mod-
els to learn high-resolution local features by training on
small image tiles, and leads to WSI-level tasks by aggregat-
2

ing tile-level embeddings [2, 7, 23, 24, 34]. As molecular
phenotypes and cellular contexts vary across localized re-
gions, tile-level alignment can provide a more fine-grained
correspondence between image features and transcriptomic
signals than slide-level alignment.
Motivated by this, our work focuses on tile-level align-
ment between HE and ST features, enabling cross-modal
learning at a spatially-resolved and fine-grained level.
Foundation models for HE and ST.
Foundation mod-
els have recently emerged in computational histopathology
for both HE images and ST. For HE image, DINO[29]-
based vision foundation models enable scalable learning
of morphology-rich representations that generalize across
slides [7, 34, 37], . Extending this line of work, hierar-
chical transformers leverage the intrinsic multi-scale struc-
ture of WSIs and learn representations across cellular, tis-
sue, and slide levels [6]. In parallel, ST foundation models,
inspired by large language models, learn cell-level repre-
sentations by treating gene expression profiles as sequences
using transformer architectures [3–5, 38].
These uni-modal foundation models provide generaliz-
able representations for HE and ST, serving as building
blocks for downstream multi-modal alignment.
In this
work, we build upon these foundation models to learn a uni-
fied cross-modal representation between HE and ST.
HE-ST contrastive alignment.
Early attempts to predict
ST profile directly regressed spot-level expression from HE
image using convolutional neural networks or transformer
backbones [9, 10].
Recent methods introduced spatial
graphs, representing spots as nodes connected by proxim-
ity and formulated the ST prediction problem as node-level
regression task [10]. With the advent of high-resolution ST,
the paradigm has shifted from spot to cellular/subcellular-
level modeling, leading to cell-graph approach [11] and
diffusion-based image-to-expression generation at subcel-
lular resolution [41]. In parallel, contrastive learning–based
approaches have emerged that align HE and ST modalities
rather than predicting one from the other, enriching cross-
modal representations and improving downstream predic-
tion [33, 40].
VL frameworks extend contrastive align-
ment, pairing HE tiles with biomedical text or gene-token
sequences to learn joint representations [1, 20, 27]. Recent
works leverage ST to perform spatially resolved alignment
between image regions and Visium spot-level expression
[8, 12, 14], with subsequent studies extending this to cell-
level alignment with Xenium data [13].
In contrast, our framework introduces graph-based
multi-scale alignment between HE and ST. We represent
each ST tile as a cell graph constructed from cell coordi-
nates and perform alignment with HE tile at multiple spatial
scales, maintaining spatial consistency and enabling fine-
grained cell-level correspondence across modalities.
3. Problem Definition
We consider paired HE images and ST profiles obtained
from the same tissue section k, denoted by (Ik, Sk), where
each spans Hk × Wk pixels, with Hk and Wk representing
height and width of the section. For simplicity, we omit the
section index k. I and S are tessellated into m × m pixel
sized tiles, {(Ii, Si)}n
i=1, where n =

is the
number of tiles extracted in a WSI. We train an HE image
encoder f(·) and an ST encoder g(·), each parameterized by
a neural network, where the encoders yield latent HE em-
bedding zI
i = f(Ii) and latent ST embedding zS
i = g(Si),
respectively. The objective is to jointly optimize the HE
image and ST encoders such that paired HE and ST embed-
dings, (zI
i , zS
i ), are aligned in a shared latent space, thereby
capturing the cross-modal correspondence between HE and
ST.

Graph neural network.
Let G = (V, E) be a graph
where V
denotes the set of nodes and E the set of
edges.
Graph neural networks (GNN) learn node repre-
sentations through iterative message passing between con-
nected nodes. We denote the embedding of node v ∈V
at layer l as h(l)
v , and define N(v) as the set of neighbor-
ing nodes of v determined by the edge set E. At the l-th
iteration, each node updates its embedding by aggregating
information from N(v) as follows [16]:

Stochastic edge addition for GNN.
Stochastic edge ad-

applied to document graphs [30] and chemical graphs [31].
Given node embeddings hu and hv learned via GNN, a
probability distribution function ϕ(·) for edge selection is
defined as follows:
suv = ϕ(hu, hv) = σ

where [·, ·] denotes the concatenation operator, σ denotes a
non-linear activation function. Here, suv is the score indi-
cating the likelihood of forming an edge between nodes u
and v.
To create a stochastic edge selector from the score, a bi-
nary variable puv ∈{0, 1} is drawn from the Bernoulli dis-
tribution puv ∼{ π1 := suv, π0 := 1 −suv}. The Gumbel

5. Proposed Method: SIGMMA
Here, we present SIGMMA, a framework for Spatial tran-
scriptome–histology Image representation learning via hi-
erarchical Graph-based Multi-scale Multi-modal Alignment
(Fig. 2). SIGMMA consists of three components: a multi-
scale HE encoder (Sec. 5.1), a multi-scale ST encoder (Sec.
5.2), and a multi-modal multi-scale contrastive alignment
component (Sec. 5.3).
5.1. Multi-scale HE encoder
To capture the hierarchical spatial contexts of an HE tile,
which is an RGB image Ii ∈Rm×m×3, we adopt a multi-
crop strategy [15, 26] using pretrained image encoders f(·)
(Fig. 2a). For simplicity, we omit the tile index i in this
section and the following section. Each HE image tile I is
partitioned into a varying grid size that captures various ROI
scales (Fig. 2 red, green, blue box): 4×4 grid micro patches
{Imicro,j}16
j=1 , 2 × 2 grid meso patches {Imeso,j}4
j=1 , and
a macro patch {Imacro,j}1
j=1, where j enumerates patches
within each grid in this section.
After extracting patch features from each ROI scale, we
resize and interpolate each patch to a unified scale, match-
ing the training resolution of the HE foundation model [7].
At each micro, meso, and macro scale, the resulting patch
embeddings are then mean-pooled to obtain tile-level im-
age embeddings, zmicro, zmeso, zmacro, which capture local to
broader spatial contexts, respectively.
zI
micro = PoolI(f(Imicro))
zI
meso = PoolI(f(Imeso))
zI
macro = PoolI(f(Imacro))
where PoolI(·) is a grid-wise mean pooling operator.
5.2. Multi-scale ST encoder
Graph Representation of ST.
Given an m × m pixel-
sized ST tile, S, we can detect 2D coordinates of individual
cells within the tile. Then, S can be represented as a cell
graph G = (V, E), where V denotes cells, and E denotes
edges that capture cell-cell interactions. Node embeddings
are initialized by the ST foundation model [3].
Hierarchical graph structure learning.
We adapted a
stochastic edge addition algorithm (Sec. 4) to reconcile the
4

difference in granularity between HE and ST. To this end,
we hierarchically expand a small subgraph by linking its
neighbors (Fig. 2c).
Specifically, we first extract a subgraph Gmicro
=
(Vmicro, Emicro), where Vmicro ⊆V and Emicro ⊆E, such
that cells within the corresponding image tile Imicro are
connected by edges defined based on spatial proximity
[35]. Edges are stochastically added by a stochastic edge-
addition layer ψ(l)(·) followed by GNN layers.
In each
layer ψ(l)(·), given each node u, neighbor nodes are up-
dated by sampling from the candidate set, and edges are
connected to the selected nodes as follows:
Nmeso(u)(l−1) = N (l−2)
micro (u) ∪{ v | ∀v →p(l−1)
uv
= 1 }
Nmacro(u)(l) = N (l−1)
meso (u) ∪{ v | ∀v →p(l)
uv = 1 }
where v ∈N∗(v) denotes a neighbor of node v connected
through edges defined at each scale, and puv denotes edge
selection probability (Sec. 4). Here, instead of treating all
nodes as candidates, we enforce a neighbor-patch constraint
that allows edges to form only between nodes in adjacent
patches. This yields distinct graph topologies at each scale:
Gmicro, Gmeso, Gmacro.
These steps above describe how the ST encoder g(·)
learns node embeddings from each scale-specific graph
(Fig. 2b). Given the node embeddings learned from graph
topology, we obtain graph-level representations as follows,
zS
micro = PoolS(g(Gmicro))
zS
meso = PoolS(g(Gmeso))
zS
macro = PoolS(g(Gmacro))
where PoolS(·) is global attention pooling operator [25]
over nodes.
Neighbor-patch constrained edge addition.
Here, we
elaborate on how spatial constraints restrict edge addition
to neighboring subgraphs. Given cell coordinates (xp, yq)
on a 2D grid, we divide the grid into local blocks of size
b × b. Each node p belongs to a block indexed as follows:
bx(p) =
jxp
b
k
,
by(q) =
jyq
b
k
.
An edge (p, q) is allowed only if both nodes lie within the
same block, i.e.,
1intra(p, q) =
(
1,
if bx(p) = bx(q) and by(p) = by(q),
0,
otherwise.
This constraint enforces edge connectivity only within each
b × b local grid, preventing cross-block edges. b=1, 2, 4 for
macro, meso, and micro scale, respectively.
5.3. Multi-modal multi-scale contrastive alignment
Contrastive learning, a mainstream of self-supervised learn-
ing, has been extended to multi-modal domains [27, 32]. In
our framework, the objective of contrastive learning is to
train the two encoders f(·) and g(·) jointly that maximizes
alignment of the latent representations of paired HE and ST
tiles (Ii, Si) while minimizing similarity across unmatched
pairs. We utilized InfoNCE loss [28] to achieve this objec-
tive:

LALIGN(zI, zS) = 1

where N is the number of samples within a batch, the in-
dex j runs over all samples in the batch, sim(·, ·) denotes
the cosine similarity between embeddings, τ is a temper-
ature parameter controlling the sharpness of the similarity
distribution.
At each scale, we compute a contrastive loss between
the HE and ST tile embeddings (Fig. 2d). The micro-level
loss LMICRO is computed between the micro-scale embed-
dings, i.e., LMICRO = LALIGN(zI
micro, zS
micro), Similarly, the
meso-level loss LMESO aligns the meso-scale embeddings
(zI
meso, zS
meso), and the macro-level loss LMACRO aligns the
macro-scale embeddings, (zI
macro, zS
macro), respectively. The
total objective function is as follows:
L = LMICRO + LMESO + LMACRO
6. Experiments
Datasets.
We conduct extensive benchmarking on the
HEST-1k dataset [23], the largest publicly available dataset
of paired HE and ST data.
Four subsets of the dataset
provide paired HE–Xenium ST data, covering four can-
cer types:
Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC), Pancre-
atic Adenocarcinoma (PAAD), Skin Cutaneous Melanoma
(SKCM), and Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In addition
to the public datasets, we include an in-house skin dataset.
Following the tiling scheme in multiple histopathology im-
age foundation models [7, 34, 37], we tessellate each WSI
into 256 × 256 pixel-sized tiles at 20x magnification level,
which corresponds to 0.5µm/pixel resolution. For more de-
tails on data preprocessing/data splits, see Supplementary
Material.

Uni-modal HE image encoder, UNI [7]; (2) Multi-modal
vision–language (VL) models pre-trained on natural im-
age–caption pairs, CLIP [32], or medical text, PLIP [20];
(3) HE–ST contrastive alignment models, including Omi-
CLIP [8], which uses a text encoder by representing ST
as a 1D sequence of gene names, and BLEEP [40], a sim-
ple MLP operating on batch corrected ST principal com-
ponents. To ensure fair comparison, all baselines are fine-
tuned on the datasets used in this study. For each method,
we adopt the hyperparameters reported in the original pa-
per; when unavailable, we determine them through grid
search. For more details on the experiment setting, see Sup-
plementary Material.
• Task 1. Gene expression prediction. We perform lin-
ear probing on HE tile embeddings extracted from image
encoders trained with SIGMMA and baseline models, fol-
lowing the HEST-1k benchmarking protocol [23]. To pre-
vent information leakage, the linear probe is trained and
evaluated strictly on the training and test splits used dur-
ing model training. Each HE tile embedding is reduced to
256 dimensions using PCA, followed by a simple ridge
regression model trained to predict the expression levels
of the top 50 highly variable genes. We report tile-level
prediction performance as the mean ± standard deviation
across tiles, using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)
and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as evaluation metrics.
• Task 2. Cross-modal retrieval We report Recall@p%,
defined as the fraction of queries whose true counterpart,
i.e., the HE–ST tile pair obtained from the same spatial
location, appears within the top p% (p=5, 10, 15) of re-
trieved candidates. The metric quantifies how accurately
the model aligns HE and ST modalities at the tile level.
The metric is evaluated on test tiles that were excluded
during model training, ensuring a fair assessment.
6.1. Task 1. Gene expression prediction
Here, our focus is to evaluate the quality of the learned im-
age representation for gene expression prediction. There-
fore, to avoid introducing biases from different methods’
gene expression decoders, we use the image embedding out-
put by each method and apply a ridge regression for gene
expression prediction for each method. Multi-modal align-
ment consistently enriches HE image embeddings by in-
corporating ST information (Tab. 3). When applying SIG-
MMA on top of ResNet50 [17], H-Optimus-0 [34], or UNI
[7], SIGMMA improves representations across backbones,
achieving up to 67% lower MSE and 56% higher PCC with
UNI. Given its strong gains, we used UNI as the HE encoder
6

backbone for all subsequent experiments.

We then compared SIGMMA with existing baselines
across five datasets (Tab. 1). Across all datasets, SIGMMA
achieves the highest PCC. While SIGMMA does not always
obtain the lowest MSE, SIGMMA consistently ranks among
the top-performing models, highlighting its stable and ro-
bust performance across diverse tissue types.
6.2. Task 2. Cross-modal retrieval
Tab. 2 summarizes the cross-modal retrieval performance
for both HE→ST and ST→HE. SIGMMA delivers strong
and consistent gains over existing baselines across most
datasets, while overall performance on IDC remains rel-
atively weak.
Overall, SIGMMA achieves strong bi-
directional alignment on most of the benchmark datasets.
6.3. Qualitative evaluation
Cell-aware attention via SIGMMA
We analyzed the at-
tention map of image encoders from SIGMMA.
In HE,
the white areas within tissue correspond to adipose regions
where lipids get washed out during processing, so they ap-
pear as cell-sparse empty spaces (Fig. 3, row 1, Input).
With SIGMMA, the attention clearly focuses on nuclei-rich,

cell-dense regions, showing sharp and localized activations
around individual cells, which means it actually captures
fine-grained cell morphology (Fig. 3 row 1, Head 5-6). On
the other hand, the baseline image foundation model, UNI,
tends to put more attention on tissue boundaries and adipose
regions, which are cell-sparse areas (Fig. 3 row 2, Head 5-
6). Even though these regions don’t contain cells, they still
stand out morphologically, so UNI attends to these coarse
structural cues rather than true cell-level features. Similarly,
SIGMMA shows low attention scores in the out-of-tissue re-
gions (Fig. 3, row 3–4, Head 2, 4, 6). Overall, these results
demonstrate that SIGMMA effectively shifts the model’s fo-
cus from coarse tissue structures to biologically meaningful,
cell-level morphology.
6.4. Ablation study
As shown in Tab. 4, we analyze the impact of the core com-
ponents of SIGMMA: (1) cell graph, (2) multi-scale loss,
and (3) graph sparsification via stochastic edge addition.
For the ablation of the cell graph, we replaced the spatial
graph representation with a 1D sequence of genes. For the
ablation of multi-scale loss, we removed the micro- and
meso-scale objectives and trained only with the macro-scale
(single-scale) alignment loss.
For the ablation of graph
sparsification module, instead of selectively sampling edges
through stochastic addition, we connected all nodes within
neighboring patches, resulting in a fully connected local
graph. Tab. 4 shows that each component contributes to
performance gains: adding the multi-scale loss and graph
sparsification progressively improves prediction accuracy,
with all components combined achieving the lowest MSE
and highest PCC. The ablation study for Task 2 is pro-
vided in the Supplementary Material.
Overall, the abla-
tion study shows that each component contributes to perfor-
mance, with multi-scale loss and graph sparsification hav-
ing the largest impact.

licly available section from PAAD tissue. For more details
on the section, see Supplementary Material, which includes
a full description of the dataset composition and sources.
We performed clustering of SIGMMA embeddings at the
micro, meso, and macro-scale and projected these clusters
back onto a PAAD tissue section, comparing them with ref-
erence cell labels (Fig. 4a). Across all three scales, the
inferred microenvironments formed coherent and spatially
contiguous domains. Most notably at the micro- and meso-
scales, SIGMMA cleanly delineated tumor nests from sur-
rounding non-tumor tissue, despite the absence of any su-
pervision from cell-type labels. To characterize the cellu-
lar context represented by these embeddings, we quantified
the cell-type composition of each microenvironment clus-
ter, focusing on the micro-scale (Fig. 4b). We identified
six resolvable microenvironments. Two microenvironments
were composed predominantly of tumor cells.
A third
represented an inflammatory infiltrate enriched for multi-
ple immune cell types, including T cells and B cells, that
were spatially excluded from the tumor region. Three addi-
tional microenvironments corresponding to known pancre-
atic structures, including perivascular, endocrine, and ex-
ocrine compartments. These patterns are consistent with
the expected organization of pancreatic tumor tissue and in-
dicate that SIGMMA learns fine-grained microenvironmen-
tal structure directly from spatial molecular context. Fi-
nally, we asked whether the learned embeddings capture rel-
evant molecular signatures. Differential expression analysis
between tumor-associated microenvironments and the im-
mune microenvironment excluded from the tumor identified
two chemokines, CXCL2 and CXCL6, both implicated in
the recruitment of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppres-
sive myeloid cells that can mediate T cell and B cell ex-
clusion in other cancer contexts [19]. Spatial projection of
CXCL2 and CXCL6 expression confirmed that both signals
localize sharply to tumor regions in the PAAD section, con-
sistent with a tumor-specific chemokine program (Fig. 4c),
Overall, these results show that SIGMMA not only recov-
8

ers structural hallmarks of immune exclusion in PAAD but
also resolves molecular features that may contribute to the
establishment of immunosuppressive cell states within the
tumor microenvironment. Thus, SIGMMA captures biologi-
cally interpretable tissue organization across scales and re-
veals spatially coherent molecular programs that align with
the underlying architecture of pancreatic cancer.
7. Conclusion
In this work, we presented SIGMMA, a hierarchical multi-
modal alignment framework that learns joint representa-
tions of HE and ST across micro, meso, and macro scales.
Although multi-scale contrastive learning has been explored
in other domains, SIGMMA is the first to address the
graph receptive field–ROI mismatch that uniquely arises in
cell-resolution ST. SIGMMA effectively captures both fine-
grained cellular structure and broader tissue context.
