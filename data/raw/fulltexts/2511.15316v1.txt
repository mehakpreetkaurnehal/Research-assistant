Abstract
Split DNNs enable edge devices by offloading intensive
computation to a cloud server, but this paradigm exposes
privacy vulnerabilities, as the intermediate features can be
exploited to reconstruct the private inputs via Feature In-
version Attack (FIA). Existing FIA methods often produce
limited reconstruction quality, making it difficult to assess
the true extent of privacy leakage. To reveal the privacy
risk of the leaked features, we introduce FIA-Flow, a black-
box FIA framework that achieves high-fidelity image re-
construction from intermediate features. To exploit the se-
mantic information within intermediate features, we de-
sign a Latent Feature Space Alignment Module (LFSAM)
to bridge the semantic gap between the intermediate fea-
ture space and the latent space. Furthermore, to rectify dis-
tributional mismatch, we develop Deterministic Inversion
Flow Matching (DIFM), which projects off-manifold fea-
tures onto the target manifold with one-step inference. This
decoupled design simplifies learning and enables effective
training with few image–feature pairs. To quantify privacy
leakage from a human perspective, we also propose two
metrics based on a large vision-language model. Experi-
ments show that FIA-Flow achieves more faithful and se-
mantically aligned feature inversion across various models
(AlexNet, ResNet, Swin Transformer, DINO, and YOLO11)
and layers, revealing a more severe privacy threat in Split
DNNs than previously recognized.
1. Introduction
Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remark-
able performance in various applications, including au-
tonomous driving [3, 37], smart security [27, 28, 36], and
smart mobile devices [8, 21, 39, 42]. Although performance
gains are largely driven by increasing model scale and
architectural complexity [14], the resulting computational
demands render on-device implementation impractical for

resource-constrained edge devices. To offload the majority
of computation to cloud servers, Split DNNs have been pro-
posed [13, 45], which divide a DNN into a lightweight head
submodel on edge devices and a computationally intensive
tail submodel on cloud servers, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The
effectiveness of split computing critically depends on iden-
tifying optimal partition points that balance edge computa-
tion, cloud processing, and communication overhead across
different model architectures and edge device capabilities.
Beyond computational efficiency, split computing is of-
ten regarded as a privacy-preserving technique, as raw input

data remains on the client’s local device [1, 13, 15, 34, 44].
However, with the enhanced capabilities of image gen-
eration [16, 17], this assumption requires serious recon-
sideration. While classic model inversion attacks (MIA)
[12, 22, 23, 30, 50, 55] exploit final model outputs to recon-
struct training data, split computing exposes intermediate
feature representations during transmission, creating a more
direct and vulnerable attack surface. The potential adver-
saries include malicious attackers intercepting transmitted
features and curious cloud servers analyzing user features
beyond their intended computational scope.
This gives rise to the feature inversion attack (FIA),
which aims to reconstruct the original input images from
intermediate features. Despite growing research interest in
this threat model, existing FIA methods face three limi-
tations (shown in Fig. 1(b) and Table 1): (i) White-box
assumptions: Most existing approaches assume white-box
access to model architectures and weights [5, 20, 24, 32,
40], limiting their generalization to diverse real-world split
computing deployments.
(ii) Heavy data dependence:
Learning-based methods [2, 53] typically require extensive
training datasets with paired features and ground-truth im-
ages, which are difficult to obtain in realistic scenarios. (iii)
High computational cost: Optimization-based approaches
[5, 20, 24, 32, 53] require thousands of iterative optimiza-
tion steps per sample, making real-time attacks infeasible
and easily detectable due to excessive query patterns.
To address these limitations, we propose FIA-Flow, a
black-box FIA framework built on an alignment-refinement
paradigm that simultaneously achieves one-step inference
and data-efficient training, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Specifi-
cally, the alignment stage employs a Latent Feature Space
Alignment Module (LFSAM) that bridges the semantic gap
between task-specific intermediate features and generative
latent spaces. LFSAM progressively fuses multi-channel
information and adapts to diverse network layers and ar-
chitectures, mapping the intermediate feature into a struc-
turally aligned latent representation. Furthermore, the re-
finement stage develops the Deterministic Inversion Flow
Matching (DIFM), inspired by flow-matching (FM) [26].
Unlike conventional generative models [29, 56], DIFM
learns a deterministic vector field to project these coarsely
aligned features onto the natural data manifold, correcting
distributional mismatch and recovering fine-grained visual
details. Crucially, FIA-Flow operates in a black-box set-
ting, requiring only query access to intermediate features,
and can be trained effectively with a small collection (fewer
than 4, 096 image-feature pairs, i.e., < 0.32% of ImageNet-
1K), making it highly practical for real-world split comput-
ing scenarios. The main contributions are as follows:
• Black-box FIA framework: We propose FIA-Flow, a
black-box FIA framework that can eliminate iterative op-
timization without requiring access to the victim model,
thereby revealing the risks present in split computing.
• Data-efficient alignment-refinement strategy: We de-
couple the FIA task into a two-stage paradigm combining
LFSAM for cross-space feature mapping and DIFM for
distributional correction with few samples.
• One-Step Inference via DIFM: We develop DIFM that
learns a deterministic vector field to enable high-fidelity
reconstruction in a single forward pass, eliminating the
iterative optimization of optimization-based methods and
multi-step sampling of diffusion-based FIA models.
2. Method
2.1. Overview and Problem Formulation
Let M : X →F denote the head submodel of the victim
Split DNN system, where X ⊆RH×W ×C is the space of
private input images. For a given input x ∈X, the model
M produces an intermediate feature f = M(x) at a spe-
cific split layer, where f ∈F ⊆RDf and Df is the fea-
ture dimension. The primary objective of FIA is to learn
an inversion mapping G : F →X that can reconstruct the
original input x′ from its corresponding feature f, such that
the reconstructed image x′ = G(f) ≈x is perceptually and
semantically indistinguishable from the original input x.
Our attack operates under a black-box assumption,
where the architecture and parameters of M are unknown.
We can only query to obtain a set of image-feature pairs
D = {(xi, fi)}N
i=1 for training. To achieve this, FIA-Flow
adopts an alignment-refinement strategy, as shown in Fig. 2.
We decouple the complex inversion mapping G into a two-
stage process: a structural alignment stage and a semantic
refinement stage, which can be formulated as:
x′ = G(f) = Dec(Grefine(Galign(f)))
(1)
Dec : Z →X denotes the decoder of Variational Autoen-
coder (VAE) [18]. The alignment stage Galign : F →Z
establishes structural correspondence by aligning the task-
relevant feature spaces and latent space of the VAE. How-

ever, this alignment primarily yields an off-manifold repre-
sentation, which lacks the semantic richness. Therefore, the
refinement stage Grefine : Z →Z performs intra-space se-
mantic enhancement, correcting the distributional mismatch
to ensure high-fidelity inversion.
2.2. Latent Feature Space Alignment Module
Motivation and Objective
A fundamental challenge in
FIA arises from the space gap between F and the latent
space Z. Since F is task-specific and optimized for classi-
fication rather than synthesis, its structure is inherently in-
compatible with the manifold of Z [51]. Therefore, a direct
mapping from feature f to image x is ill-posed. To bridge
this gap, we propose the LFSAM to transform a given inter-
mediate feature f into a latent tensor zs = Galign(f), which
is designed to be both dimensionally compatible and struc-
turally aligned with the latent space of VAE. The VAE is
selected for its continuity and structured latent space, of-
fering an ideal manifold for stable and coherent refinement
[6]. Meanwhile, the low-dimensional latent space reduces
the complexity of the hypothesis class, making alignment
learning easier to generalize under few-sample conditions
[48]. This enables FIA-Flow to effectively learn and ex-
trapolate robustly to unseen features.
Cross-Space Feature Alignment
LFSAM comprises a
learned upsampling module, a backbone, and a Feature
Aggregation Network (FAN) to synthesize a comprehen-
sive latent representation. To accommodate features with
varying resolutions across different network layers, we
employ a PixelShuffle-based spatialization layer PS
:
R(r2Cin×Hin×Win) →R(Cin×rHin×rWin).
Unlike stan-
dard interpolation, this operation provides a learned trans-
formation that unfolds channel-encoded spatial information
into an explicit geometric grid.
The backbone B(·) processes f through a hierar-
chical encoder, which extracts a set of feature maps
{e1, e2, . . . , eL}.
Its corresponding decoder reconstructs
the output progressively from the deepest feature level. Cru-
cially, at each stage, the decoder integrates features from the
corresponding encoder stage via skip connections, a process
formulated as di+1 = D(concat(di, ei)). To capture global
context and long-range spatial dependencies, we embed
self-attention mechanisms within the backbone layers, pro-
ducing Fd = B(f). Meanwhile, FAN projects each ei into
a shared space via 1 × 1 convolutions ϕi then concatenates
and fuses them: Ffan = Convfuse(concatL
i=1(ϕi(ei))). The
final aligned feature is:
zs = Convout(Fd + Ffan),
(2)
which serves as a structural alignment feature for the subse-
quent refinement stage.
2.3. Deterministic Inversion Flow Matching
Motivation and Objective
With the space-aligned latent
feature zs obtained from LFSAM, we aim to generate a
photorealistic inversion image x′ that closely resembles the
private input x. A naive approach involves directly decod-
ing the aligned feature zs using a pre-trained VAE decoder
x′ = Dec(zs). However, experimental results demonstrate
that this straightforward method produces suboptimal re-
sults with severe blurriness and semantic inconsistencies.

The core issue is a distributional mismatch between the
aligned features and the natural data manifold. Although
LFSAM ensures that zs conforms to the dimensional re-
quirements of the VAE latent space, it fails to guarantee that
zs follows the same distribution as the authentic latent fea-
ture generated by the VAE encoder from natural images.
Since zs originates from a task-specific feature transforma-
tion, it likely resides in off-manifold regions of the latent
space Z. The VAE decoder is trained exclusively on on-
manifold samples, cannot interpret out-of-distribution in-
puts, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality. There-
fore, we propose the DIFM to enhance semantic expressive-
ness based on the previous structural alignment.
Intra-Space Feature Enhancement
To overcome the
limitations of direct decoding, we reframe zs as a high-
quality starting point for a generative process rather than
a final latent feature. We employ the DIFM to learn a deter-
ministic vector field vθ(z, t) that transforms the distribution
of our structurally-aligned features p0 = p(zs) to the target
data distribution p1 = p(zx), where zx = Enc(x). This ap-
proach adapts the standard FM framework by replacing the
conventional Gaussian prior p′
0 = N(0, I) with our mean-
ingful initializations p(zs).
Specifically, we define a linear interpolation path be-
tween the starting point zs and its corresponding target zx
as zt = t · zx + (1 −t) · zs for t ∈[0, 1]. DIFM is trained
to approximate this target field ut = dzt/dt = zx −zs.
Once trained, this learned vector field defines the trajec-
tory of each point via the probability flow ordinary differen-
tial equation (ODE), dˆzt/dt = vθ(ˆzt, t), and the continuity
equation describes its distributional evolution:
∂tpt(z) + ∇z · (pt(z)vθ(z, t)) = 0.
(3)
This equation formalizes the desired behavior of vθ(z, t),
ensuring it guides the population of points from the initial
distribution p0 to the target data distribution p1. Since LF-
SAM already produces zs close to zx, the learned vector
field is simple, allowing us to replace an expensive ODE
solver with a single forward Euler step from t = 0 to t = 1:
ˆzx = ˆz1 = zs + vθ(zs, t = 0).
(4)
The final inversion image x′ is decoded by the VAE:
x′ = Dec(ˆzx). By conditioning the generative process on
a meaningful initialization, our strategy effectively trans-
forms a complex generation task into a residual correction
problem. This simplifies the learning dynamics of the vec-
tor field, reducing the data requirements, thereby enabling
high-fidelity inversion even with limited training samples.
2.4. Training Strategy
We adopt a two-stage training paradigm for the FIA task.
This decoupled approach is designed first to establish a
space alignment and then to optimize the generative model.
Stage 1: Training the LFSAM. In the first stage, we train
the LFSAM to learn a mapping from the task-relevant in-
put features f to the VAE latent space. Our objective is to
ensure that the LFSAM produces structured features zs that
closely approximate the ground truth (GT) VAE latent fea-
ture zx of the corresponding images x. We employ a pre-
trained, frozen VAE encoder to obtain target latent codes
zx = Enc(x). To ensure feature space alignment, we mini-
mize the L2 distance between the zs and zx:
Lfea = E(x,f)∼D

∥zs −zx∥2
2

.
(5)
To enforce perceptual coherence, we apply an image-
domain reconstruction loss. We decode the generated latent
zs, and minimize the L1 distance to the GT image x:
Limg = E(x,f)∼D [∥Dec(zs) −x∥1] .
(6)
The total loss for Stage 1 is the sum of these two losses:
Ls1 = Lfea + Limg.
(7)
Stage 1 ensures that the LFSAM learns a meaningful
projection into the VAE latent space, providing a solid foun-
dation for the subsequent stage.
Stage 2: Training the DIFM. In the second stage, we
freeze the LFSAM and train the DIFM, which takes the pre-
computed features zs as a starting point and learns to gener-
ate the final image x′. The training objective for this stage
is a combination of two losses:
1. Flow Matching Loss (Lfm): This is a regression loss
that minimizes the L2 distance between the model’s pre-
dicted vector field vθ(zt, t) and the target vector field ut:
Lfm = Et∼U[0,1],(x,f)∼D

∥vθ(zt, t) −ut∥2
2

.
(8)
2. Reconstruction Loss (Lrec): To ensure that the final
output x′ is perceptually and semantically faithful to
the original image x, we apply a reconstruction loss di-
rectly in the image space. This loss is a combination of
Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) [52]
loss and a pixel-wise L1 loss:
Lrec = E(x,f)∼D [ LLPIPS(x′, x) + LL1(x′, x)] .
(9)
The final loss for Stage 2 is the sum of these two losses:
Ls2 = Lfm + Lrec.
(10)
3. Experiments
3.1. Datasets and Metrics
Our experiments were conducted on a subset of ImageNet-
1K [4]. Specifically, we randomly sample only 4,096 im-
ages (< 0.32%) from the training set for training and 1,000

then prompted to describe the inversion image. ③The LVLM compares these two descriptions to ascertain if the same object is identified. A
consistent result yields the LVLM-C value of 1. ④LVLM-PL is obtained by computing the BERTScore [54] between the two descriptions.
We employ a comprehensive set of Image Quality As-
sessment (IQA) metrics. For full-reference IQA, we use
the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Simi-
larity Index Measure (SSIM), and LPIPS [52].
For no-
reference IQA, we utilize the Natural Image Quality Eval-
uator (NIQE) [33] and MANIQA [49].
Furthermore, to
measure the eavesdropping information accuracy, we as-
sess the inversion image top-1 classification accuracy (Acc)
with the GT label of the original image, using ResNet-50
[7]. To assess private information leakage, we propose two
novel metrics evaluated by Large Vision-Language Mod-
els (LVLMs): LVLM-Consistency (LVLM-C) and LVLM-
Privacy-Leakage (LVLM-PL). As shown in Fig.
3, the
LVLM acts as an Image Description Expert, generating tex-
tual descriptions for both the original and inversion im-
ages. These descriptions are compared by an Image Leak
Inspector to determine whether they depict the same pri-
mary object (LVLM-C) and to compute their semantic sim-
ilarity via BERTScore [54] (LVLM-PL). Higher LVLM-C
and LVLM-PL values indicate that the attacker can extract
more detailed private information from the inversion im-
age. In our implementation, we utilize gpt-4o-mini as the
LVLM. See supplementary materials for the detailed calcu-
lation process and an ablation study with other LVLM.
3.2. Implementation Details
We selected features.10 (F-10) of AlexNet [19], layer1.2
(L1-2) and layer4.2 (L4-2) of ResNet-50 [7],
fea-
tures.3.0.mlp.2 (F3-2) of Swin Transformer (Swin-B) [31],
model.8 (M-8) of YOLO11n [11], and blocks.11 (B-11) of
DINOv2-B [35] as the victim layers and models for FIA.
The DIFM is initialized with the pre-trained weights of Sta-
ble Diffusion 2.1 [41]. To adapt it for the FIA task, we
freeze the U-Net in the DIFM and integrate a Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) [10] model with a rank of r = 4. For
both stages, we set the batch size to 8 and the learning rate
to 0.0001, with each stage trained for 64, 000 iterations. All
experiments were conducted on NVIDIA A100 GPUs.
3.3. Main results
We compare the proposed FIA-Flow with state-of-the-art
FIA methods, including M&V [32], Deep Image Prior
(DIP) [5], Adversarially Robust (AR) [40], Self-Guided
DIP (SG-DIP) [24]. Additionally, we compared against a
baseline FIA-Align that solely employs LFSAM for feature
space alignment, followed by VAE decoding.
Quantitative Results
Table 2 shows the results of differ-
ent FIA methods for various victim models and layers. For
AlexNet, FIA-Flow achieves an Acc of 28.8%, showing a
significant advantage over other methods. For ResNet-50,
when dealing with information-rich shallow features (L1-
2), FIA-Flow can achieve an outstanding Acc of 71.3%.
This performance remains robust even when dealing with
deep features from the L4-2 layer, which typically suffer
from substantial information loss. While other methods ex-
perience a dramatic degradation in image quality, leading to
significant drops in both Acc and LVLM-based evaluations,
FIA-Flow maintains an Acc of 36.8% and an LVLM-PL of
0.902. Furthermore, experiments on the Swin Transformer

model (Swin-B), object detection model (YOLO11n), and
foundation model (DINOv2-B) confirm the superiority of
FIA-Flow, highlighting its broad applicability and effective-
ness across diverse model architectures.
Benefiting from the alignment-refinement strategy, FIA-
Flow not only achieves a higher inversion quality on
IQA metrics but also exhibits substantially better semantic
preservation, as validated by Acc and LVLM-based metrics.
This proves that FIA-Flow constitutes a more effective and
practical privacy threat.
Qualitative Results
As shown in Fig. 4, our FIA-Flow
outperforms other methods on both ResNet-50, Swin-B,
YOLO11n, and DINOv2. While other methods fail or pro-
duce blurry results, FIA-Flow can invert images with excep-
tional clarity, accurately capturing fine details like the face,
wireless router, and lighthouse. This visually confirms its
state-of-the-art performance and robustness across diverse
architectures. More visual results are available in the Sup-
plementary Materials.
Robustness Evaluation Under Defenses
To verify the
robustness of FIA-Flow under different defense mecha-
nisms, we evaluate all methods against two representative
defenses: Noise+NoPeek [46] and DISCO [43], as shown
in Table 3 and Fig. 5. Under the Noise+NoPeek defense,
where Laplacian noise is injected into intermediate features
and a NoPeek strategy [47] is employed to restrict infor-
mation leakage, FIA-Flow still outperforms other methods.
Similarly, under the DISCO defense, which suppresses in-
termediate features, FIA-Flow remains effective, recover-
ing the original image with minimal samples. This demon-
strates that FIA-Flow can effectively bypass defense mech-
anisms and extract sensitive information, even in a black-
box setting, without access to the defense’s implementation
details and model parameters.
Generalization Evaluation Across Diverse Datasets
We evaluate on the MS COCO-2017 dataset [25] to demon-
strate the generalization capability of FIA-Flow (See Ta-
ble 4). To quantify privacy leakage beyond standard IQA,
we introduce the Object Reconstruction Rate (ORR),
which measures the consistency between the outputs of

quire sample-specific optimization on target features. This
cross-dataset generalization is mainly attributed to the
alignment–refinement design of FIA-Flow, which learns a
dataset-agnostic mapping from task features to the VAE la-
tent space. High ORR obtained by FIA-Flow indicates that
the inverted images retain task-relevant semantics for down-
stream models, revealing a stronger privacy risk than IQA
metrics alone capture. The definition of ORR and the com-
plete results are shown in the Supplementary Materials.

different training numbers of FIA-Flow. (b) Right: Performance
comparison at different layers.
Results on Different Training Numbers
To test data
efficiency, we trained on the ResNet-50 L4-2 layer us-
ing datasets ranging from 4,096 (0.32%) down to just 128
(0.01%) samples, shown in Table 5 and Fig. 6(a). Using
only 128 samples (0.01%), FIA-Flow not only achieves a
high Acc of 27.7% but also outperforms other methods. The
data efficiency can be attributed to LFSAM, which enforces
structural alignment with the latent space through feature
rearrangement that matches its dimensionality and hierar-
chical aggregation that reduces the mapping complexity and
sample requirements.
Results on Different Layers
We evaluate FIA-Flow at
various depths of ResNet-50, shown in Table 6 and Fig.
6(b). While performance degrades in deeper layers, FIA-
Flow consistently outperforms other methods across all vic-
tim layers. Notably, its performance on the deep L3-2 layer
(69.8% Acc) exceeds SG-DIP’s 65.2% on the shallow L1-
2 layer. Despite the loss of spatial detail in deeper layers,
FIA-Flow effectively uses high-level semantic information
for accurate reconstruction. This capability underscores a
serious privacy concern: FIA-Flow can recover visually de-
tailed and semantically meaningful images from abstract
representations.
Results on Different Sampling Methods and Steps
The
performance gap between diffusion probabilistic model
(DDPM) [9] and DIFM reflects not only efficiency but
also methodological suitability for FIA. The iterative “add-
noise, then-denoise” paradigm of DDPM is an indirect and

stochastic process designed for diverse sampling, making
it difficult for the high-fidelity reconstruction of a spe-
cific input. In contrast, FIA-Flow adopts a deterministic
alignment-refinement paradigm, enabling efficient, high-
fidelity inversion. As shown in Table 7, one-step DIFM
is highly effective. Increasing sampling steps slightly de-
creases PSNR but improves Acc and LVLM-based scores,
suggesting increased privacy exposure.
4. Conclusion
In this work, we introduce FIA-Flow, a data-efficient black-
box FIA framework for high-fidelity feature inversion in
Split DNNs.
Benefiting from the alignment-refinement
strategy, FIA-Flow significantly outperforms state-of-the-
art methods, especially in recovering details across diverse
architectures and layers. FIA-Flow’s effectiveness and data
efficiency demonstrate that Split DNNs face a more se-
vere and practical privacy threat than previously recognized.
These findings underscore the urgent need for designing ro-
bust and efficient defense mechanisms that can mitigate pri-
vacy risks while preserving model utility and inference per-
formance.
