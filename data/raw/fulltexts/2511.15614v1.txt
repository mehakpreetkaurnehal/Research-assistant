Introduction
The deployment of intelligent robotic systems in high-stakes environments, such as nuclear power plants (NPPs),
represents a transformative approach to enhancing operational safety, efficiency, and environmental monitoring. As the
complexity of nuclear facilities increases, there is an urgent need for robots capable of adaptive learning—systems that
can continuously learn from their surroundings, adapt to dynamic conditions, and perform critical tasks autonomously.
The Optimus-Q robot embodies this innovation by integrating advanced sensing technologies and machine learning
algorithms to monitor environmental conditions and predict contamination events in real-time.
Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of robotics in hazardous environments. For example, Khatib et
al. [1] highlighted the role of robotic systems in emergency response scenarios, showcasing their ability to navigate
complex terrains and perform tasks that would be dangerous for human operators. In the context of NPPs, the integration
of robotics can mitigate risks associated with radiation exposure and enhance the monitoring of air quality, a critical
aspect of maintaining safe operational standards [2].
The application of deep learning techniques for robotic perception has revolutionized environmental monitoring,
enabling systems to analyze sensor data with high accuracy. Zhang et al. [3] conducted a comprehensive review of deep
learning applications in environmental sensing, revealing the significant advancements made in detecting and classifying
various contaminants in real-time. Furthermore, the use of federated learning paradigms has emerged as a promising

solution for training machine learning models across decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy [4]. This
is particularly relevant in NPPs where sensitive data must remain confidential due to regulatory requirements.
In addition to the advancements in machine learning, the incorporation of quantum technologies into robotic systems
offers enhanced capabilities for secure data transmission and processing. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) provides a
method for ensuring secure communication between robots and centralized control systems, leveraging the principles of
quantum mechanics to detect eavesdropping attempts [5]. The potential for integrating QKD with robotics has been
explored in various contexts, demonstrating its effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive operational data [6].
The proposed methodology for the Optimus-Q robot combines these advanced technologies, creating a robust framework
that integrates adaptive learning, predictive analytics, and secure quantum communication. By equipping the robot
with a range of sensors, including infrared detectors for gas monitoring, we enable real-time detection of hazardous
gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4) [7]. Moreover, the robot’s ability
to autonomously navigate predefined bounding boxes allows for systematic coverage of critical areas, enhancing the
efficiency of contamination monitoring [8].
A significant aspect of our methodology is the implementation of a federated learning approach, which allows the
Optimus-Q robot to learn collaboratively from multiple data sources without compromising privacy. This decentralized
learning method has been shown to improve model accuracy while reducing the risks associated with data sharing [9].
The aggregation of knowledge from various robots operating across different NPPs enables the development of a global
model that enhances the robot’s predictive capabilities regarding contamination detection [10].
The contributions of this work are twofold: first, we present a detailed framework for the Optimus-Q robot’s adaptive
learning and operational capabilities, essential for addressing the unique challenges posed by nuclear facilities. Second,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology through simulations and real-world experiments, highlighting its
potential to enhance monitoring systems in high-stakes environments. The integration of advanced robotics, machine
learning, and quantum technologies offers a promising avenue for improving safety and operational efficiency in NPPs.
Our paper aims to present our findings on the Optimus-Q robot’s capabilities and provide insights into the future of
robotic applications in hazardous environments.

Methodology
The proposed methodology encompasses several essential components designed to facilitate adaptive learning for
quantum human assistant robots operating within nuclear power plants. These components are integral to ensuring that
the robots can effectively learn from their environments, enhance their operational capabilities, and respond dynamically
to the unique challenges posed by high-stakes settings such as nuclear facilities. By integrating these elements, we aim
to create a robust framework that supports the continuous improvement and adaptability of the robots in their roles as
intelligent assistants.
3.1
Optimus-Q Responsibilities
In this section, we provide an in-depth discussion regarding the various operational states of the Optimus-Q robot, a
sophisticated system designed to enhance monitoring and safety within NPPs. Our analysis begins with the foundational
assumption that the Optimus-Q robot is equipped with advanced capabilities to continuously stream sensor data in
real-time, which is essential for maintaining optimal operational efficiency and safety standards in a high-stakes
environment such as a nuclear facility.
The Optimus-Q robot is not merely a passive data collector; it possesses the advanced functionality to detect and predict
potential contamination events within the NPP. This predictive capability is crucial, as it allows for proactive measures
to be taken before contamination can pose a risk to both personnel and the environment. In this context, we elaborate
on the specific types of sensor data that our system expects to receive from the Optimus-Q robot.

3.1.1
Sensors
In the quest to enhance environmental monitoring in NPPs, a robot can be equipped with a variety of advanced sensors
to detect contamination levels. Among these, infrared sensors are particularly important as a starting point for our
experiments. These sensors are adept at detecting specific gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO),
and methane (CH4), by measuring the absorption of infrared light at designated wavelengths. This capability allows
for real-time monitoring of hazardous gas concentrations, making infrared sensors a crucial tool for early detection of
potential leaks and ensuring immediate safety responses.
While other sensors, such as Geiger-Müller counters, scintillation detectors, alpha and beta particle detectors, particulate
matter sensors, volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), are
vital for detecting various types of radiation and airborne contaminants, infrared sensors offer a non-invasive and rapid
assessment of gas emissions. Starting with infrared sensors not only provides a solid foundation for understanding gas
dynamics in the environment but also allows for swift identification of air quality issues, forming a critical component
of a comprehensive contamination monitoring strategy in nuclear facilities.
3.1.2
Scanning State
One of the primary responsibilities of the Optimus-Q robot is to systematically scan the nuclear power plant while
continuously monitoring for various contamination zones. This section specifically addresses this critical function.
Each robot will operate within a predefined bounding box, where its task is to navigate the designated area without
encroaching upon the boundaries of adjacent boxes. This approach is designed to facilitate efficient traffic management
among multiple robots operating simultaneously.
The bounding boxes can take on various shapes; however, rectangular or square configurations are preferred for practical
reasons. Utilizing shapes such as circles would introduce unnecessary complexity, as arranging circular bounding boxes
within the nuclear power plant’s layout would inevitably create gaps or voids between them. Consequently, adopting a
square shape simplifies the execution of the primary scanning objective.
The specific latitudes and longitudes defining each bounding box will be programmed into every Optimus-Q robot.
Additionally, each robot will initialize with a model that is downloaded from a global server, which will be further
elaborated upon in subsequent sections. This model will guide the robot’s operations and enhance its ability to detect
and assess contamination effectively within the designated areas.
Lawnmower Pattern Coverage. In this section, we elaborate on the methodology by which the Optimus-Q robot will
efficiently cover a square area using a systematic lawnmower pattern. We start by determining the number of strips
necessary to adequately cover the width of the square area. This calculation is crucial for ensuring optimal coverage
and effective navigation throughout the designated space. Let W be the width of the square (in meters, calculated from
latitude/longitude difference) and w be the effective coverage width of the robot. The number of strips, n, is then given
by:
n =
W
w

,
(1)
where ⌈·⌉denotes the ceiling function, rounding up to the nearest integer to ensure complete coverage.
Next, we determine the length of each strip. If L is the length of the square (in meters, also calculated from
latitude/longitude), the length of each strip, l, is simply:
l = L.
(2)
For a perfect square, the length of each strip equals the side length of the square.
The total distance traveled by the robot, D, in an ideal scenario, can be calculated as:
D = n · l + (n −1) · d,
(3)
where d represents the distance the robot travels to move from the end of one strip to the beginning of the next (the
“turn” distance). This formula assumes direct movement between adjacent strips.
To determine the starting coordinates of each strip, we assume the bottom-left corner of the square is the origin (0, 0) of
our local coordinate system. Let (xi, yi) be the starting coordinates of the i-th strip (where i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n −1). If
the strips are oriented vertically, the coordinates are:
xi = i · w,
(4)
yi = 0.
(5)
4

Optimus-Q: Federated Learning and Quantum Cryptography in NPP Robots
Conversely, for horizontally oriented strips, the coordinates are:
xi = 0,
(6)
yi = i · w.
(7)
Finally, to calculate W and L from latitude and longitude coordinates, we can use a simplified version of the Haversine-
style approximation for relatively small distances. Let (lat1, lon1) and (lat2, lon2) be the latitude and longitude of two
points in decimal degrees, and let R be the Earth’s radius (approximately 6,371,000 meters). Define ∆lat = lat2 −lat1
and ∆lon = lon2 −lon1. The approximate distance between the two points (in meters) is:
distance ≈R ·

∆lat · π
180
2
+

cos

lat1 · π
180

· ∆lon · π

.
(8)
This approximation is most effective for shorter distances. However, when dealing with larger areas, it is essential
to employ more accurate methods or libraries to ensure precise coverage and navigation. For long-range distance
applications, algorithms such as A* search, Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), and Dijkstra’s algorithm are
particularly suitable. These algorithms can efficiently determine optimal paths and navigate complex environments,
making them ideal for large-scale operations.
It is important to note that, for the purposes of our experiments and the implementation of our architecture, the speed and
direction of the Optimus-Q robot are preset to specific ranges. This controlled configuration allows us to systematically
evaluate the robot’s performance and adaptability under defined conditions, facilitating a more focused assessment of
our methodology.
3.1.3
Critical State
This state is a critical component of our system, as it represents the ideal operational condition for the Optimus-Q
robot when it encounters air quality contamination or detects the presence of hazardous gases. The Optimus-Q is
equipped with advanced infrared sensors specifically designed to identify elevated levels of carbon dioxide (CO2),
carbon monoxide (CO), and excess methane (CH4) emissions in the environment. The functionality of our predictive
algorithms is particularly significant in this context, as they play a vital role in identifying potential contamination
hotspots—referred to as “red spots”—and conducting further tests in those areas.
The Optimus-Q continuously streams input data from its infrared sensors, allowing it to monitor air quality in real-time.
This ongoing data collection enables the robot to predict concentrations of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and
methane gases with high accuracy. To ensure effective monitoring, threshold levels for these gases are established using
collective models that are aggregated at the global server level. This aggregation process synthesizes data from multiple
robots, enhancing the reliability of our predictions and ensuring that the system can respond promptly to contamination
events.
Once a contamination spot is detected, the Optimus-Q robot will transmit critical information, including the latitude
and longitude coordinates of the identified location, along with the specific measurements of the elevated gas levels.
These measurements may include any combination of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane, providing
comprehensive data that can inform further investigation and remediation efforts. This systematic approach not only
enhances the robot’s ability to address air quality issues effectively but also contributes to the overall safety and
operational efficiency of the nuclear power plant environment via the local server mentioned in Fig. 1. Once the
information is transmitted to the local server and the Optimus-Q receives an acknowledgment, it will begin to move in
the specified direction and focus on the designated areas.
3.1.4
Charging State
The charging state is a critical component in the operation of the Optimus-Q robot, particularly for the ongoing training
and updating of its predictive model. During the scanning phase, if the battery level of the Optimus-Q drops below 20%,
the robot will automatically return to its designated charging dock to recharge. For the purposes of our experiments, we
have assumed that each bounding box previously discussed will contain its own charging station. However, in future
iterations, there may be a centralized charging station for all Optimus-Q robots located in a single area. This centralized
approach could significantly simplify maintenance procedures and streamline operations.
To reduce the complexity of our proposed system, we have implemented the approach of having preset coordinates for
the charging stations stored within the Optimus-Q robot’s navigation system. When the battery level reaches the critical
20% threshold, the robot autonomously navigates to the charging dock. Upon arrival, it initiates the wireless charging
process, allowing for a seamless transition into the training phase.
5

Figure 2: The figure depicts the bounding box within which the Optimus-Q robot will operate to identify contamination
zones.
Figure 3: The picture outlines the various roles and responsibilities of Optimus-Q, highlighting its preset attributes.
While charging, the Optimus-Q robot begins to train its machine learning model using historical sensor data collected
during the previous operational session—defined here as the time elapsed since the last charging event. This session’s
sensor data is retrieved from the robot’s internal memory, enabling the model to learn from past experiences and improve
its predictive capabilities.
Once the training phase is completed and the model reaches a satisfactory performance, the robot will disconnect from
the charging dock and revert to its scanning state, ready to resume its monitoring duties. However, if the robot reaches
a full charge without completing the training process, it will remain docked and continue training until the update is
finalized.
An additional crucial step that occurs after the model training is the interaction with the global server. The Optimus-Q
robot engages in a federated learning process, allowing it to assimilate knowledge from other similar nuclear power
plants in the vicinity. This collaborative learning enhances the robot’s operational efficiency and adaptability, further
strengthening its ability to detect and respond to contamination in its environment.
3.2
Secure Quantum Channels
Once the model has been successfully trained and generated using the historical session data collected by the Optimus-Q
robot while it is docked for charging, we proceed with the federated learning process. This process, described later,
enables the Optimus-Q to collaboratively learn from data while maintaining data privacy and security across multiple
robots and facilities.
6

Optimus-Q: Federated Learning and Quantum Cryptography in NPP Robots
The model produced during this training phase will consist of classical bits, represented as binary values (0 or 1).
However, to leverage the advantages of quantum communication, we convert this classical model into quantum states,
specifically qubits. Each qubit can be assigned a spin or polarization, which represents information beyond traditional
binary encoding. This transformation allows us to utilize the unique characteristics of quantum mechanics to enhance
security for data transmission.
Once the model has been converted into qubits, the entire dataset will be transmitted through a secure quantum channel.
At this stage, QKD will play a pivotal role in ensuring the security of the data transmission. QKD utilizes the principles
of quantum mechanics to generate and distribute cryptographic keys that can be used for encrypting the data being sent.
One of the most widely used QKD protocols is the BB84 protocol, which operates on the principle of superposition and
the no-cloning theorem.
The process of implementing QKD within the Optimus-Q system involves several critical steps. First, during the key
generation phase, the Optimus-Q robot creates a secret key using a series of qubits that are transmitted over a quantum
channel. Each qubit can exist in a superposition of states, mathematically represented as:
|ψ⟩= α|0⟩+ β|1⟩,
where |ψ⟩is the state of the qubit, |0⟩and |1⟩are the basis states, and α and β are complex coefficients that satisfy the
normalization condition |α|2 + |β|2 = 1.
Following this, in the key distribution stage, the generated key is transmitted to the global server via the quantum
channel. Importantly, if an eavesdropper attempts to intercept the qubits, any measurement conducted on them will
disturb their state, thus alerting the communicating parties to the presence of the eavesdropper. The disturbance can be
quantified using the quantum bit error rate (QBER), defined as:
QBER = E
N ,
where E is the number of erroneous bits detected, and N is the total number of bits transmitted. A higher QBER
indicates a greater likelihood of interception.
Once the key is securely distributed, the next step is data encryption. The secret key is utilized to encrypt the classical
bits of the model, ensuring that the data remains confidential during transmission. This encryption process can be
mathematically represented by the one-time pad encryption method, where the encrypted message E is expressed as:
E = M ⊕K,
in which M represents the original message (the classical model bits), K is the secret key generated via QKD, and ⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation. The security of this encryption method relies on the key K being truly random and
at least as long as the message M.
Finally, during the transmission phase, the encrypted data E is sent through the quantum-secured classical channel,
guaranteeing that the integrity and confidentiality of the data are upheld throughout the transfer process. The effective-
ness of the QKD protocol can be further illustrated by the following inequality, which ensures the security of the shared
key:
I(A : E) ≤S,
where I(A : E) is the mutual information between Alice and Eve (the eavesdropper), and S is the secrecy capacity
of the channel. This inequality demonstrates that the information available to the eavesdropper must be minimized to
maintain the confidentiality of the key.
Upon reaching the global server, we decrypt the transmitted data using the shared key. The ability to share model
information with quantum-secured keys not only enhances the security of data handling but also opens new avenues for
improving the predictive capabilities of the Optimus-Q robot through collective learning across various nuclear power
plants.
The integration of QKD in this context is particularly effective because it provides a level of security that is unattainable
with classical cryptographic methods. The inherent properties of quantum mechanics ensure that any attempt to
eavesdrop will be detectable, thus safeguarding sensitive data throughout its transmission. This innovative approach
to model training and data transmission exemplifies the potential of integrating quantum technologies with robotic
systems, ultimately leading to more robust and intelligent monitoring solutions in high-stakes environments such as
nuclear facilities.
3.2.1
Technical Drawbacks
One of the drawbacks we have identified through our experiments is that while integrating QKD into a communication
system, such as that utilized by the Optimus-Q robot, offers considerable security benefits, it also introduces various
7

Optimus-Q: Federated Learning and Quantum Cryptography in NPP Robots
latency-related challenges. One key issue is the time-consuming nature of key generation, as QKD relies on the
transmission and measurement of qubits, which can delay the overall process, especially over long distances or in the
presence of noise and signal loss in the quantum channel.
Additionally, after generating a key, QKD often necessitates further steps such as error correction and privacy amplifica-
tion to ensure key reliability and security, which involve additional computations and communications that contribute
to latency. The performance of QKD is highly dependent on the quality of the quantum channel, and factors such as
attenuation and environmental interference can exacerbate delays. Furthermore, establishing a QKD connection requires
an initial setup phase to configure the quantum channel and agree on parameters for key generation, adding significant
latency, particularly in dynamic environments where Optimus-Q may frequently need to establish connections.
QKD systems also tend to be resource-intensive, requiring sophisticated hardware and protocols that may not be
optimized for speed; this complexity can slow data exchange compared to classical key distribution methods, which are
generally faster due to simpler infrastructures. Finally, in scenarios where real-time data transmission is critical—such
as in monitoring systems like the Optimus-Q robot—any added latency from the QKD process could impact the
system’s responsiveness, hindering the robot’s ability to react quickly to contamination events or other critical situations.
Therefore, while QKD offers unparalleled security advantages, its integration necessitates careful consideration of
optimizing the QKD process, improving quantum channel quality, and ensuring that the overall system architecture can
accommodate the inherent delays associated with quantum key generation and distribution.
3.3
Local Server
The primary objective of the local server is to facilitate technicians’ access to monitoring data and deliver near real-time
updates regarding environmental conditions within the nuclear facility. This capability is particularly crucial when it
comes to promptly addressing any instances of contamination detected by the Optimus-Q robot.
3.3.1
Monitoring Systems
The local server receives data whenever the Optimus-Q robot identifies signs of environmental contamination, leveraging
its advanced sensing technology. Specifically, the robot is equipped with infrared sensors that are adept at detecting
elevated levels of gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4). These sensors play
a vital role in ensuring that any hazardous changes in air quality are rapidly recognized and communicated to the local
server.
When contamination is detected, the transmission of data to the local server will encompass several key pieces of
information. This includes the geographical coordinates, specifically the latitude and longitude, which are essential for
accurately pinpointing the location of the contamination. In addition to the location data, the transmission will contain
precise measurements of the gas levels for carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane. These readings are critical
for assessing the severity of the contamination and determining the appropriate response measures.
To enhance the utility of the monitoring data, each transmission will also include a timestamp, providing context
regarding when the contamination was detected. This temporal information is invaluable for tracking the progression of
contamination events and for conducting thorough analyses of air quality over time. By consolidating this data, the local
server ensures that technicians are equipped with timely and relevant information, enabling them to make informed
decisions and take immediate action in response to any environmental hazards identified by the Optimus-Q robot.
3.3.2
Secure Data Transmission
The ChaCha encryption algorithm is a modern and efficient stream cipher that can be utilized for securing data
transmitted from the Optimus-Q robot to the local server. This algorithm is particularly well-suited for environments
requiring high-speed encryption and decryption, as it maintains both security and performance. When the Optimus-Q
robot detects environmental contamination, the data collected—including latitude, longitude, gas measurements (carbon
dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane levels), and timestamps—needs to be securely transmitted to the local server.
Before transmission, this sensitive information is encrypted using the ChaCha algorithm, ensuring that the data remains
confidential and protected against potential eavesdropping or tampering.
The encryption process involves the generation of a unique key and nonce for each session, which enhances security
by preventing replay attacks. Once the data is encrypted, it is transmitted over the communication channel to the
local server, where it can be decrypted and analyzed by technicians. By employing the ChaCha algorithm, the system
ensures that real-time monitoring data is transmitted securely, allowing for immediate and informed responses to any
environmental hazards detected by the Optimus-Q robot.

Optimus-Q: Federated Learning and Quantum Cryptography in NPP Robots
3.4
Global Server
The goal of the global server is to perform the federated aggregation received from different Optimus-Q robots across
various nuclear power plants (NPPs). We have opted for FedAvg at the global server level to perform our operations.
3.4.1
Federated Learning
Federated learning is a decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables multiple devices to collaboratively learn a
shared model while keeping their training data local. This approach is particularly relevant in environments where data
privacy, security, and compliance are critical concerns, such as in nuclear power plants. By allowing the Optimus-Q
robot and other similar devices to learn from their experiences without transferring sensitive data to a central server,
federated learning enhances data privacy and reduces the risk of exposing confidential information.
In our system, once the Optimus-Q robot successfully completes its training process and generates its local model while
connected to the charging dock, the subsequent step involves transmitting the acquired local model weights to the global
server. This transmission is facilitated through a secure channel whose keys are established using QKD to ensure that
the data is transmitted safely across the network. By utilizing QKD to provision encryption keys, we protect the model
weights from potential interception and unauthorized access, thereby safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality of
the sensitive information being exchanged.
Let wt represent the global model weights at iteration t, and let wt
i denote the local model weights of the i-th Optimus-Q
robot after performing local training on its dataset for E epochs. The FedAvg algorithm proceeds as follows:
1. Each robot i initializes its model with the current global weights wt.
2. Each robot conducts local training using its own data for a defined number of epochs E, resulting in updated weights
wt
i. A simple local update can be written as
wt
i = wt −η∇Fi(wt),
(9)
where η is the learning rate, and ∇Fi(wt) is the gradient of the local loss function for robot i evaluated at wt.
3. After completing the local training, the robots transmit their updated weights back to the global server. The server
aggregates these weights using a weighted average based on the number of data samples available to each robot ni:
wt+1 =
N
X
i=1
ni
PN
j=1 nj
wt
i,
(10)
where N denotes the total number of participating robots.
The aggregation process is critical, as it ensures that the global model reflects the insights and learning gleaned from the
diverse operational environments of all participating robots. Once the aggregation is complete, the resultant global
model weights are transmitted back to the client nodes, which in this case are the Optimus-Q robots. This updated
global model, enriched with knowledge from multiple clients, allows the robots to enhance their understanding of
environmental conditions and improve their predictive capabilities regarding contamination detection. By leveraging
insights from a broader dataset, the Optimus-Q robots can better identify and anticipate areas of potential contamination,
leading to more effective monitoring and response strategies in NPPs. This collaborative learning framework not only
optimizes the performance of individual robots but also contributes to a more robust and intelligent overall monitoring
system.
3.4.2
Convergence Considerations
The convergence of federated learning, particularly when utilizing the FedAvg algorithm, is essential for determining
the effectiveness and efficiency of the model training process, especially in the context of the Optimus-Q robot. In our
implementation, multiple Optimus-Q robots operate in various locations, each collecting environmental data, including
measurements of CO2, CO, and CH4 levels. The goal is to collaboratively learn a global model that reflects the
collective knowledge gained from diverse operational environments while ensuring that individual data remains secure
and private.
Under common assumptions such as smoothness of the local loss functions and bounded variance of stochastic gradients,
FedAvg can be shown to converge toward a critical point of the global loss function F(w), defined as a weighted sum
of local losses:
F(w) =
N

where Fi(w) is the local loss for robot i. While exact convergence rates depend on step sizes, data heterogeneity, and
the number of local steps, practical deployments can empirically verify convergence through monitoring training and
validation losses across communication rounds.

Experiments
This section elucidates the experimental procedures employed to validate the proposed methodology for the Optimus-Q
robot, focusing on its interactions with the global server, the data collection process, contamination detection, and
secure data transmission.
The experiments were designed to evaluate the performance of the Optimus-Q robot in a simulated nuclear power plant
environment. The primary goal was to assess its ability to autonomously receive an updated operational model from
the global server, perform real-time data collection using infrared sensors, detect contamination events, and securely
transmit crucial information back to the server. We considered two NPP setups, with each plant featuring four distinct
Optimus-Q robots. The experiments were conducted with these eight Optimus-Q robots over a total of 30 epochs (or
sessions), where one session corresponds to a full charge-discharge cycle.

Table 1: Comparison metrics between Nuclear Power Plant 1 and Nuclear Power Plant 2 based on performance across
thirty sessions. Each session is defined as one full charge-to-charge cycle of an Optimus-Q robot.
4.1
Model Retrieval from the Global Server
Upon being powered on, the Optimus-Q robot establishes a connection to the global server with the primary objective
of requesting the most up-to-date predictive model. This model is of paramount importance, as it encompasses the
necessary algorithms and parameters that enable the robot to perform its tasks with optimal effectiveness. Among the
initial parameters that the Optimus-Q robot comes equipped with are several key components: the bounding box, which

defines the operational area; the lawnmower pattern algorithm, which dictates the robot’s movement strategy; movement
speeds that determine how quickly the robot can traverse its environment; a low charging threshold to manage its power
efficiency; and various security algorithms designed to ensure safe operation within its designated area.
4.2
Data Stream and Sensor Integration
With the operational model firmly established, the Optimus-Q robot is fully equipped to initiate its primary function:
environmental monitoring within the nuclear facility. This critical task encompasses a comprehensive data collection
process, which is essential for ensuring the safety and integrity of the environment in which it operates.
The robot continuously gathers data from its onboard infrared sensors. These sensors measure concentrations of various
gases that can indicate hazardous conditions—specifically, CO2, CO, and CH4. This real-time data acquisition is vital
for maintaining stringent safety standards within the nuclear facility, where even minor fluctuations in gas concentrations
could signal potential risks.
Once the data is collected, it undergoes a processing phase locally within the robot’s system. This processing allows
for the assessment of air quality in the immediate environment. Additionally, the robot employs predictive algorithms
to anticipate potential contamination events. Such proactive predictions are invaluable, as they enable technicians to
respond swiftly and effectively, reaching the contaminated area in a timely manner to mitigate adverse effects.
In scenarios where the robot detects any signs of contamination—be it through abnormal gas concentrations or other
environmental indicators—it is programmed to take immediate action. The robot will either halt its movements to
prevent further exposure or shift into a critical state, serving as an urgent alert mechanism that signifies that immediate
attention is required. By implementing this responsive strategy, Optimus-Q enhances its operational effectiveness and
plays a vital role in safeguarding the health and safety of personnel working within the facility.
4.3
Contamination Detection Process
When the Optimus-Q robot detects that contamination levels exceed predefined safety thresholds, it promptly gathers and
transmits vital data, including its geographic coordinates—specifically, the latitude and longitude of the contaminated
area—alongside the excess levels of harmful gas concentrations detected by its infrared sensors. These measurements
encompass key pollutants such as CO2, CO, and CH4. To ensure the secure transmission of this sensitive data from the
Optimus-Q robot to the local server, the ChaCha secure encryption algorithm is employed, providing a robust layer of
security against potential unauthorized access or data tampering during the communication process. This meticulous
approach underscores the robot’s commitment to safety and efficiency in its operational duties.
4.4
Secure Data Transmission to the Local Server
The process commences with the critical phase of data preparation, during which the robot meticulously gathers
essential information required for subsequent transmission. This information includes various parameters such as
contamination levels, geographical coordinates that pinpoint the exact location of the contamination, and timestamps
that specify when the contamination was detected. These elements are fundamental for ensuring accurate tracking and
response to contamination events.
Once the data collection is complete, the robot encrypts the gathered information using a secure key via the ChaCha
algorithm. The encoded data is then transmitted to a local server through conventional communication channels, which
may include Wi-Fi or cellular networks. The use of encryption serves as a robust protective measure, ensuring that even
if the data is intercepted during transmission, it remains unreadable without the corresponding decryption key.
Upon successful receipt of the transmitted data, the local server processes and logs the information. This step involves
analyzing the data for further insights and maintaining a record for future reference. Following the processing, the
server sends an acknowledgment back to the robot, confirming that the data has been received successfully. This
acknowledgment is crucial as it enables the robot to continue its operations seamlessly, without interruption.
4.5
Secure Data Transmission to the Global Server
The secure data transmission process to the global server is a critical component of the Optimus-Q robot’s operational
framework, particularly in the context of nuclear power plants where data integrity and confidentiality are paramount.
Transmission begins after the Optimus-Q robot has completed its local training and generated model weights based on
its environmental data collection.
11

Optimus-Q: Federated Learning and Quantum Cryptography in NPP Robots
To initiate the transmission, the Optimus-Q robot connects to its charging dock, where it prepares to send the acquired
local model weights to the global server. As discussed earlier, keys generated via QKD can be used to encrypt these
weights, ensuring that the data is transmitted safely across the network. Libraries such as Qiskit or PyQuil can
be used in a simulation environment to prototype quantum key establishment, though deployment would depend on
dedicated quantum hardware links.
Once the encrypted local model weights are transmitted, the global server receives the data and initiates the FedAvg
aggregation process. After aggregation, the updated global model weights are sent back to the Optimus-Q robots, again
protected with keys provisioned via QKD where available.
4.6
Performance Metrics
We evaluated performance metrics through two server levels: the local server and the global server. At the local server
level, our focus was on comprehensively understanding the contamination areas and assessing the accuracy of the data
associated with them. This involved analyzing the information collected by the Optimus-Q robots to determine the
precision with which these areas were identified and characterized.
At the global server level, we adopted a broader perspective to measure accuracy through the convergence of machine
learning models sourced from various Optimus-Q robots. This approach allowed us to aggregate and synthesize insights
from multiple data streams, thereby enhancing the overall reliability of our assessments. By comparing and integrating
the outputs from these diverse models, we achieved a more holistic understanding of contamination dynamics across the
entire operational landscape. This dual-level evaluation not only facilitated a nuanced analysis of local contamination
issues but also contributed to the overarching goal of improving predictive accuracy and operational effectiveness at a
global scale.

Conclusion
This paper presented the Optimus-Q robot, an advanced system designed to enhance safety and monitoring in nuclear
power plants through adaptive learning and secure quantum communication. Our methodology integrates real-time
environmental data processing and predictive analytics, enabling the robot to autonomously detect and respond to
contamination events effectively.
Experimental results across two simulated nuclear power plant setups demonstrate that Optimus-Q significantly improves
contamination monitoring accuracy and efficiency. By leveraging advanced infrared sensors, the robot can identify
hazardous gases like CO2, CO, and CH4 in real-time, facilitating timely safety measures. Federated learning enhances
the robot’s predictive capabilities without compromising data privacy, allowing it to learn from diverse operational
environments. Additionally, the integration of QKD strengthens data security during model exchange, addressing
critical information security concerns.
Overall, the Optimus-Q framework illustrates the potential of combining robotics, federated learning, and quantum-
secured communication to build intelligent, resilient monitoring systems for high-stakes environments. Future work
includes deploying Optimus-Q in physical testbeds, optimizing QKD latency, and extending the framework to multi-
modal sensing and decision-support systems.
