Abstract.
This paper introduces a classification method using in-context
learning in time-series foundation models (TSFM). We show how data,
which was not part of the TSFM training data corpus, can be classified
without the need of finetuning the model. Examples are represented in the
form of targets (class id) and covariates (data matrix) within the prompt
of the model, which enables to classify an unknown covariate data pattern
alongside the forecast axis through in-context learning.
We apply this
method to vibration data for assessing the health state of a bearing within
a servo-press motor. The method transforms frequency domain reference
signals into pseudo time-series patterns, generates aligned covariate and
target signals, and uses the TSFM to predict probabilities how classified
data corresponds to predefined labels. Leveraging the scalability of pre-
trained models this method demonstrates efficacy across varied operational
conditions.
This marks significant progress beyond custom narrow AI
solutions towards broader, AI-driven maintenance systems.

Introduction
In recent years, industries such as manufacturing, energy, transportation, and
healthcare have increasingly recognized the importance of anomaly detection to
prevent the failure of critical machines and systems. The traditional approach
to maintenance involves reactive strategies, which can lead to costly downtime,
production losses, and safety risks. As a result, many companies are shifting
towards predictive and preventive maintenance strategies, aiming to optimize
operational efficiency by preemptively addressing signs of equipment deteriora-
tion.
Despite advancements in predictive maintenance, current solutions are largely
tailored for specific applications and assets, relying heavily on domain-specific
knowledge and handcrafted rules [1].
While effective in controlled contexts,
these systems often lack flexibility and require substantial effort to adapt to new
environments or equipment.
The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced AI-driven maintenance
strategies that rely on data-driven approaches. However, existing implementa-
tions primarily depend on narrow AI solutions, trained on asset-specific datasets,

and typically struggle to scale across different machines, industries, or failure pat-
terns [1]. This limitation is due to their inability to generalize beyond predefined
conditions, forcing companies to rely on custom-built solutions that hinder the
full potential of AI-driven maintenance.
This work addresses these challenges by introducing a novel approach for
classification of data, specifically vibration data, using a time-series foundation
model (TSFM). Unlike traditional narrow AI models, TSFMs offer the gener-
alization capabilities necessary for scalable and flexible classification solutions
across different assets and operational conditions. Notably, they enable reliable
classification of data without necessitating extensive finetuning of large reference
datasets, representing a significant move towards more adaptive and generaliz-
able AI models [2].

Method
This chapter details the proposed methodology for classifying the health state
of a motor bearing using spectral data.
2.1
Time Series Foundation Models
TSFMs have emerged as a transformative paradigm for time-series forecasting,
delivering strong zero-shot and few-shot performance across a broad spectrum of
datasets and application domains [3–5]. Recent studies demonstrate that TSFMs
can match or even surpass specialized statistical models and earlier task-specific
models on unseen benchmarks. Our method is centered on the General Time
Transformer (GTT) architecture [6] that captures complex temporal patterns
and multivariate dependencies through alternating temporal and channel atten-
tions in Transformer encoder blocks. By adding a learnable sink token to the
end of channels for target variates similar to [3], and replacing the original point
forecast head with a Gaussian mixture probabilistic forecast head, we adapt
the GTT architecture for multivariate probabilistic forecast with covariates that
are available in the forecast horizon. Pretrained on a large-scale cross-domain
dataset, GTT is a general-purpose zero-shot forecaster that takes a look-back
window of L time points for one or more target variables (optionally with co-
variates) and predicts their next H values. Let x1:L and c1:L+H be the target
variates and corresponding covariates. Targets are available only in the context
window, whereas the covariates can be available also in the forecast horizon.
The model is a function that predicts the distribution of xL+1:L+H, such that
P(xL+1:L+H) = f(x1:L, c1:L+H).
2.2
Data Preprocessing
Raw vibration signals sampled at 48 kHz from a servo-press motor are processed
to compute the fast-fourier transform (FFT) [7], where each recording has a
length of ≈60 seconds. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the preprocessing divides the
whole spectrum into N = 20 data channels (covariates). For each channel, the

coded targets (orange) and corresponding covariates (blue) forms the few-shot prompt-
ing context. The model outputs a prediction of the targets w.r.t. covariates in the
forecast horizon (blue block to the right of the dashed line).
FFT is segmented into M = 64 frequency sub-bands, with the mean value from
each sub-band forming a feature. Overall, one raw vibration signal results in a
covariate structure of size N × M, used as input to the TSFM.
The system defines target variables for classification, corresponding to four
health states (classes): 1. Normal operation, 2. Outer ring fault, 3. Sand in
bearing∗, and 4. Inner ring fault. Targets are one-hot encoded (1 if the class is
present, 0 otherwise) over a prediction horizon of M = 64 time steps, enabling
sensitivity to subtle variations and emphasizing fault-indicative frequency com-
ponents (see Figs. 2 and 3).
2.3
Few-shot prompting for in-context learning classification
We apply few-shot prompting to adapt the pre-trained GTT for the asset health
classification tasks, as shown in Fig. 1.

about patterns associated with specific health states from a limited number of
examples, which is known as in-context learning or few-shot prompting.
For a new, unknown covariate input, the model predicts the corresponding
class as depicted in Fig. 4. Within 64 time steps, the model predicts the class
to which the unknown covariate data belongs. As the classification method, we
apply a winner-takes-all rule; alternatively, a discrete probability distribution
could be obtained by applying a Softmax function to the predicted intensities.

Experiments
We conducted experiments with a GTT model with 750 million parameters pre-
trained on a large-scale cross domain time series corpus with 124 billion data
points. The model can accept at most 64 channels/variates in the input context.
We use 3968 time steps on the input side, and thus are able to draw 62
random samples from our servo-press data, where each sample has a length of
M = 64 steps and N = 60 covariate channels for representing the spectrum. The
dataset comprises 280 samples almost equally distributed across all four classes
depicted in Fig. 3. Including four target variables, we have a total of 64 variables
(targets + covariates) per class sample, which corresponds to the current limit
of GTT.

A typical classification is depicted in Fig. 4, where the task was to predict
class 2_OuterRing. In the corresponding prompt, the last example was drawn
from class 4_InnerRing, explaining why the prediction for this class starts with
high intensity (around 0.7) at the beginning, but develops down to almost 0 until
step t = 64. In contrast, the intensity of class 2_OuterRing rises towards almost
1. At t = 64, the applied winner-takes-it all rule classifies the data correctly.
An extensive study has been carried out with 1000 random contexts, each
containing 63 uniformly distributed samples from all four classes, where the last
sample represents the data to be classified. Due to the random sampling process,
we investigate varied starting conditions (one-hot encoded targets within the
62nd sample) for the forecast of the 63rd sample shown in Fig. 4.
The analysis achieved excellent classification performance with an overall ac-
curacy of 96% across all samples. All four classes were identified with high pre-
cision and recall, exhibiting only minor misclassifications. These results demon-
strate that the TSFM-based approach is highly reliable and consistent in differ-

Results and Discussion
The presented methodology offers significant advantages over conventional ap-
proaches by combining pre-trained TSFMs with few-shot prompting. It enables
rapid deployment, eliminates training time, minimizes expert dependency, and
ensures scalability across diverse assets and failure modes.
The results demonstrate that aligning covariates and target data as pseudo
time-series patterns effectively utilized the TSFM’s generalization capacity. The
model achieved 96% accuracy across all samples, with high precision and recall
(F1 ≈0.95−0.98), consistently distinguishing between normal and faulty condi-
tions, although the servo-press dataset was not part of the models training data.
The FFT-based approach was crucial in highlighting fault-indicative frequencies,
and the presentation of random examples in the prompt context contributed to
robust classification, minimizing confusion between classes.
While this method is promising, limitations must be acknowledged.
The
method was applied to only four target classes. Since the context length in the
Preprint submitted to ESANN 2026

examined GTT model is limited in the number of time steps, a higher number
of classes would result in less represented examples per class. This can reduce
the prediction accuracy of the TSFM and increases the probability of misclas-
sifications. Real-world deployment may also require additional consideration of
computational and integration factors, especially if the method is implemented
on an edge device with limited memory and computation ability.
This work highlights the broader potential of TSFMs in predictive main-
tenance across industries. The method’s flexibility makes it adaptable to di-
verse assets and fault types, with future enhancements like domain-specific pre-
training or improved interpretability expected to extend its impact further.
