Abstract
Clustering short text embeddings is a foundational task in natural
language processing, yet remains challenging due to the need to
specify the number of clusters in advance. We introduce a scalable
spectral method that estimates the number of clusters directly from
the structure of the Laplacian eigenspectrum, constructed using
cosine similarities and guided by an adaptive sampling strategy.
This sampling approach enables our estimator to efficiently scale
to large datasets without sacrificing reliability. To support intrin-
sic evaluation of cluster quality without ground-truth labels, we
propose the Cohesion Ratio, a simple and interpretable evaluation
metric that quantifies how much intra-cluster similarity exceeds
the global similarity background. It has an information-theoretic
motivation inspired by mutual information, and in our experiments
it correlates closely with extrinsic measures such as normalized
mutual information and homogeneity. Extensive experiments on
six short-text datasets and four modern embedding models show
that standard algorithms like K-Means and HAC, when guided by
our estimator, significantly outperform popular parameter-light
methods such as HDBSCAN, OPTICS, and Leiden. These results
demonstrate the practical value of our spectral estimator and Co-
hesion Ratio for unsupervised organization and evaluation of short
text data. Implementation of our estimator of 𝑘and Cohesion Ratio,
along with code for reproducing the experiments, is available at

Introduction
Clustering short texts, represented as dense embeddings from trans-
former models [27], is a foundational task for organizing seman-
tically related information in domains from social media analysis
to digital health. A critical and persistent challenge in this domain,
however, is the determination of the number of clusters, k. Most
clustering algorithms either require k to be specified a priori or
depend on other sensitive hyperparameters [7, 15], which is im-
practical in exploratory settings where ground-truth structure is
unknown. This limitation severely hinders the application of clus-
tering for unsupervised knowledge discovery [16, 26].
To address the challenge of estimating the number of clusters
without prior specification, we extend the classical eigengap heuris-
tic from spectral graph theory [25, 35] to high-dimensional text
embeddings. Our method constructs a normalized graph Laplacian
from cosine similarities and applies adaptive thresholding to detect
the eigengap, yielding a data-driven estimate of k without manual
tuning. A random subsampling strategy ensures scalability on large
datasets, improving robustness across diverse text collections.
In addition, to evaluate clustering quality in the absence of
ground-truth labels, we propose the Cohesion Ratio, a simple
and interpretable intrinsic metric. This metric evaluates a clus-
tering’s quality by comparing the average intra-cluster similarity
against the global average similarity of the entire dataset. It is de-
signed to reward semantically coherent clusters and, as we will
show, correlates strongly with human-based extrinsic evaluations.
To validate our proposed methods, we conduct a large-scale em-
pirical study on six diverse short-text datasets and four modern
embedding models. We use our spectral method to guide tradi-
tional algorithms (K-Means and HAC) and compare their perfor-
mance against prominent low-configuration methods, including
HDBSCAN, OPTICS, Leiden, and Affinity Propagation. Our ex-
periments are designed to answer two central questions: (i) can
a robust spectral estimator enable traditional algorithms to out-
perform modern parameter-light methods? and (ii) how well do
intrinsic metrics, including our proposed Cohesion Ratio, align with
human-annotated labels?
This study makes the following key contributions:
• A Refined Spectral Method for Cluster Estimation:
Building on foundational work in spectral clustering, we
introduce a refined and scalable method for estimating 𝑘.
Our approach adapts the classic eigengap heuristic for high-
dimensional text embeddings through an adaptive thresh-
olding scheme and a sampling strategy inspired by recent
large-scale estimation techniques [11, 13, 21].
• The Cohesion Ratio Metric: We introduce a simple, in-
terpretable, and effective intrinsic metric for evaluating
cluster quality. Empirical results demonstrate that it corre-
lates strongly with extrinsic, label-based metrics grounded
in mutual information.
• Extensive Empirical Validation: Through rigorous ex-
periments, we show that our spectral estimation method
enables standard algorithms like HAC and K-Means to sig-
nificantly outperform dedicated low-configuration methods
on short-text clustering tasks. This provides direct, practical
guidance for researchers and practitioners.

Exploratory Text Clustering When Number
of Clusters is Unknown
Clustering of text representations has been widely explored in
natural language processing, particularly in the context of topic
discovery, concept organization, and data profiling. Traditional
approaches rely on models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation [5]
or methods operating on a vector space model of term frequencies,
which infer latent topics by modeling word co-occurrence statistics.
While effective on large corpora, these methods require substantial
preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning (e.g., number of topics), and
do not generalize well to short or sparse texts. Some attempts to
address the unknown cluster count problem within this paradigm
introduced their own limitations. For instance, the online clustering
scheme proposed by Yin and Wang [39] still required the user to
specify a maximum possible number of clusters, 𝑘𝑚𝑎𝑥.
In contrast, modern embedding-based clustering methods oper-
ate directly on dense vector representations produced by pretrained
models. Sentence-level embedding models such as Sentence-BERT
[27], E5 [36], and more recent instruction-tuned transformers have
been shown to yield high-quality representations across tasks. The
Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) [24] includes clus-
tering tasks using K-Means with known cluster counts, providing
insight into relative model performance. However, such evalua-
tions assume prior knowledge of the number of clusters, which, as
noted, remains a persistent challenge in real-world settings. This
issue is not merely an inconvenience but a fundamental barrier
to exploratory data mining, a challenge articulated compellingly
by Keogh et al. [19], who argued for a community-wide shift to-
wards parameter-free algorithms to enable more objective and re-
producible data analysis.
2.2
Parameter-Light Algorithms
Density-based methods [10] such as OPTICS [1] and HDBSCAN
[7] and message-passing approaches like Affinity Propagation [15]
attempt to remove the need for a user-specified 𝑘by exposing alter-
native hyper-parameters such as minimum cluster size, preference,
or reachability radius. Community-detection algorithms such as
Louvain and Leiden transfer this idea to similarity graphs, using
resolution parameters instead of 𝑘and offering strong scalability on
large corpora [34]. However, each of the methods have their own
shortcomings. Density-based methods are known to be sensitive to
parameter selection [23], Affinity Propagation struggles on larger
datasets due to its quadratic complexity, and community-detection
algorithms such as Louvain and Leiden are known to sometimes
produce poorly connected communities and encounter scalability
limitations on massive graphs [30].
2.3
Spectral Clustering and Estimating the
Number of Clusters
Spectral clustering constructs a graph from the similarity matrix
and derives its Laplacian, whose spectrum reveals underlying com-
munity structure [25, 35]. A widely used method for estimating
the number of clusters 𝑘is the eigengap heuristic, which selects 𝑘
based on the largest gap between consecutive eigenvalues. While
conceptually simple and computationally efficient, this heuristic
often breaks down when clusters differ significantly in scale or
density.
To address its limitations, several refinements have been pro-
posed. Self-tuning spectral clustering replaces a global scale pa-
rameter with locally adaptive bandwidths [41]. The Normalised
Maximum Eigengap approach jointly optimizes graph parameters
and 𝑘[26], while the Spectral Information Criterion formalizes
the “elbow” method using information-theoretic bounds [22]. More
recently, Yu et al. [40] introduced fuzzy spectral clustering, which
incorporates a fuzzy index to reduce sensitivity to the similarity
matrix and simultaneously learns the clustering structure.
Despite these advances, estimating 𝑘remains a persistent chal-
lenge, particularly in high-dimensional or semantically rich settings
such as textual embeddings. Our work builds on this shortcoming
by proposing a more robust and interpretable estimation technique
tailored specifically to this domain.

Methodology
3.1
Problem Formulation
Let D = {𝑥1,𝑥2, . . . ,𝑥𝑛} denote a collection of short text segments,
and let Φ : D →R𝑑be a pretrained embedding function mapping
each 𝑥𝑖to a dense vector z𝑖= Φ(𝑥𝑖). The objective is to partition the
embedding set {z1, . . . , z𝑛} into semantically meaningful clusters
using a function 𝑓: R𝑑→N, without assuming prior knowledge of
the number of clusters 𝑘or relying on extensive hyper-parameter
tuning. Here, semantically meaningful refers to clusters whose mem-
bers convey similar underlying topics, intents, or concepts, even if
they differ lexically or syntactically.
This problem setting reflects real-world exploratory scenarios
where human-aligned semantic groupings must be discovered with-
out supervision. It presents two core challenges: (i) estimating the
number of clusters𝑘in a scalable and robust way, and (ii) evaluating
clustering quality intrinsically, without reference to external labels.
3.2
Datasets
We evaluate clustering methods on six diverse short-text datasets
spanning a range of domains, including encyclopedic knowledge,
news articles, conceptual categories, and user-generated discus-
sions. Each dataset is standardized into a text-label format, where
labels correspond to gold-standard semantic categories. To ensure
fair evaluation across different sizes and label distributions, we
apply both random and stratified sampling at fixed size intervals,
resulting in a total of 62 dataset variants.
The DBpedia datasets consist of short titles and longer article
bodies from the DBpedia 14 collection, each covering 14 uniformly
distributed categories [24]. The 20 Newsgroups corpus contains
over 11,000 long-form documents grouped into 20 topical categories
with moderate imbalance [20]. BLESS is a compact concept cate-
gorization benchmark with 200 noun entries distributed across 17
fine-grained semantic classes [3]. Finally, we include two large-scale
user-generated datasets from MTEB: Reddit and StackExchange.
These cover 50 and 121 categories respectively, and are charac-
terized by moderate-length texts and substantial label imbalance
[24].

For each dataset, we compute summary statistics including the
number of instances, number of classes, average input length (in
words), and cluster imbalance (measured as the coefficient of vari-
ation of label counts). Table 1 presents the full statistics for the
original datasets.

Embedding Models
To represent short texts in a dense semantic space, we employ a
selection of pretrained sentence embedding models with diverse
architectures and training objectives. All models are openly avail-
able and can be used without fine-tuning. This diversity enables us
to evaluate the robustness of clustering methods across embedding
spaces that differ in scale, origin, and linguistic capabilities.
Our selected models include both compact encoders suitable for
low-resource scenarios and larger instruction-tuned or retrieval-
optimized architectures. Table 2 summarizes the models along with
their parameter sizes and reported performance on the Massive
Text Embedding Benchmark (as of July, 2025).

counts are given in millions (M) or billions (B). MTEB ranks

The models were chosen to balance accessibility, representational
diversity, and empirical competitiveness. This selection allows us to
disentangle clustering algorithm behavior from embedding model
biases and to test generalizability across small, multilingual, and
instruction-optimized transformers.
3.4
Clustering Algorithms
To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed cluster count esti-
mator, we apply it in combination with two standard algorithms
that require 𝑘as input: K-Means and Hierarchical Agglomerative
Clustering (HAC). These algorithms are widely used and provide
a controlled setting for isolating the impact of 𝑘estimation on
clustering performance.
For comparison, we include a set of representative low-configuration
algorithms that infer the number of clusters automatically or are in-
herently non-parametric. These serve as competitive baselines and
fall into three categories: density-based, graph-based, and similarity-
based methods.
Among the density-based methods, HDBSCAN generalizes DB-
SCAN via hierarchical density estimation, constructing a condensed
cluster tree and extracting a flat clustering with minimal param-
eter tuning. OPTICS similarly builds on the DBSCAN framework
but uses reachability plots to handle variable-density structures
without requiring a global threshold.
In the graph-based category, we employ Leiden clustering on
similarity graphs constructed from cosine similarities between em-
beddings. The algorithm detects communities using the Constant
Potts Model (CPM) [33], which promotes the discovery of well-
connected subgraphs without needing to specify 𝑘.
Finally, Affinity Propagation adopts a message-passing strategy
to identify exemplar points and induce clusters based on pairwise
similarities. Like the other baselines, it does not require 𝑘to be
predefined.
This setup allows us to assess whether traditional algorithms,
when guided by our spectral 𝑘-estimator, can outperform mod-
ern parameter-light methods under low-supervision constraints.
Appendix A provides details on algorithm usage.
3.5
Adaptive Estimation of the Number of
Clusters via Laplacian Spectrum
We propose a method to estimate the number of clusters in a dataset
by analyzing the eigenspectrum of a normalized Laplacian derived
from the cosine similarity of the samples. The approach combines
spectral gap detection with adaptive sampling to remain efficient
on large datasets.
Our method builds upon the well-established eigengap heuristic
from spectral graph theory, which suggests that a large difference
between consecutive eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian ma-
trix corresponds to a natural cluster boundary in the data [25, 35].
Formally, an ideal graph with 𝑘disconnected components has ex-
actly 𝑘zero eigenvalues of the Laplacian [35].
However, real-world similarity graphs derived from sentence em-
beddings are typically noisy, dense, and lack clearly disconnected
components, which leads to a smoothed Laplacian spectrum and
weakens the eigengap signal. To mitigate this, our estimator incor-
porates a moving-average normalization over the spectrum and
applies adaptive sampling to increase robustness at scale.
Estimation Procedure. Let X ∈R𝑛×𝑑denote the matrix of em-
beddings for a dataset with 𝑛samples, where each sample has
been mapped to a 𝑑-dimensional dense vector using the embedding
function Φ described earlier. We compute the cosine similarity ma-
trix S ∈R𝑛×𝑛and clip its entries to ensure non-negative affinities.
Since negative cosine similarities are rare in semantic embedding
spaces and usually lack meaningful interpretation [8, 12, 18], we
set 𝑆𝑖𝑗←max(𝑆𝑖𝑗, 0). We then construct the normalized Laplacian:
Lsym = I −D−1/2SD−1/2,
where D is the diagonal degree matrix with 𝐷𝑖𝑖= Í
𝑗𝑆𝑖𝑗. The
eigenvalues 𝜆1 ≤𝜆2 ≤· · · ≤𝜆𝑛of Lsym are then analyzed. A
significant jump in the spectrum, often referred to as an eigengap,
is traditionally taken as an indicator of the number of clusters.
However, in high-dimensional semantic spaces, the spectrum tends

Nikita Neveditsin, Pawan Lingras, and Vijay Mago
to decay smoothly, making it difficult to identify a single dominant
gap.
Rather than seeking the largest eigengap, our method identifies
the point at which the spectrum begins to flatten, indicating that
further eigenvalues contribute little additional structure. To detect
this transition, we employ a moving average normalization strategy.
For a given window size 𝑤, we define the normalized spectral
difference at position 𝑖as:
𝛿𝑖=
|𝜆𝑖−𝜆𝑖−1|
1
𝑤
Í𝑖−1
𝑗=𝑖−𝑤𝜆𝑗+ 𝜖
,
for 𝑖= 𝑤+ 1, . . . ,𝑛, where 𝜖is a small constant to ensure numerical
stability. We compute these normalized differences 𝛿𝑖across the
upper half of the spectrum (i.e., for indices 𝑖> 𝑛/2, since we do
not expect the number of clusters to exceed half the sample size),
and denote their sample mean and standard deviation by E[𝛿] and
𝜎[𝛿], respectively.
Notably, preliminary experiments on our text embedding datasets
reveal that standard eigengap heuristics consistently return values
of 𝑘< 5, even when the ground truth number of categories is
substantially larger. This behavior supports the interpretation that
classic eigengap heuristics are ill-suited for spectral analysis over
dense semantic graphs, where signal is distributed more gradually
across the spectrum. Thus, we traverse the spectrum in reverse,
searching for the first index 𝑖such that:
𝛿𝑖> E[𝛿]

1 +
𝜎[𝛿]
E[𝛿] + 𝜖

.
The multiplicative term reflects a data-dependent threshold that
scales with the relative variation in spectral differences. This for-
mulation ensures that the selected point in the spectrum is not
only larger than the average change but also exceeds typical fluctu-
ations observed across the spectrum, capturing only meaningful
transitions in spectral decay. An example of this detection process
is shown in Figure 1, which visualizes the Laplacian spectrum, nor-
malized differences, and adaptive threshold for the BLESS dataset.
To scale this method to large datasets, we apply adaptive sam-
pling: if 𝑛> 𝜏, where 𝜏is a maximum sample size (e.g., 1000), we
draw multiple random subsets and average the estimated number
of clusters across replicates. We set the number of replicates as
𝑟= log2(𝑛) · 10, allowing the number of subsampled evaluations
to scale smoothly with dataset size. This adaptive growth balances
computational cost with the stability of cluster number estimation,
similar to practices in bootstrap-based and ensemble clustering
methods. This ensemble approach is motivated by recent work in
scalable cluster estimation, such as the kluster procedure [11],
bootstrap-based estimators [13], and ensemble eigengap estimation
methods for big data [21]. Algorithm 1 summarizes the procedure.
The ComputeEigenvalues subroutine computes the cosine simi-
larity matrix S from X, rectifies to non-negative, forms symmetric
normalized Laplacian, and returns sorted eigenvalues Λ. The Esti-
mateKFromSpectrum subroutine computes normalized differences
𝛿𝑖with window 𝑤on eigenvalues Λ, sets the adaptive threshold,
traverses reverse to find first 𝛿𝑖> threshold for ˆ𝑘, defaulting to
𝑘default (chosen as a conservative prior for short-text corpora) if
none found.
Figure 1: First half of Laplacian eigenvalue spectrum and nor-
malized spectral differences (𝛿𝑖) for the BLESS dataset. The
detected number of clusters ˆ𝑘is shown as a vertical dashed
line. The detection window (light gray) marks the region
used for local averaging before the detected jump. The dotted
line represents 𝛿𝑖values, and the horizontal dashed line indi-
cates the adaptive threshold computed from the mean and
variance of spectral differences. A significant over-threshold
jump at ˆ𝑘signals the point where spectral flattening begins,
suggesting the cut-off for meaningful clustering.

Sensitivity Analysis for 𝑤and 𝜏. We evaluate the effect of the
moving average window size 𝑤on the accuracy of cluster count
estimation. For each value of 𝑤, we compute the mean relative error
between the estimated and true number of clusters across datasets,
along with the average fraction of failed predictions returned by
the estimator (when it needed to fall back to 𝑘default).
Figure 2 summarizes these results. As the window size increases,
the average relative error tends to grow, indicating reduced esti-
mation precision due to oversmoothing. Notably, the fraction of
invalid predictions also rises with larger windows, reflecting a loss
in estimator selectivity. Moderate window sizes 𝑤≲7 offer the best
trade-off between accuracy and robustness. These results support
the use of 𝑤= 3 as a default setting.
Further, to balance estimation accuracy and computational cost,
we conducted an ablation study across multiple values of the sam-
pling threshold𝜏∈{200, 500, 1000, 2000}. Results showed that while

(solid line, left axis) and average fraction of invalid predic-
tions (dashed line, right axis).
larger values of 𝜏increase the runtime due to the O(𝜏3) complexity
of eigendecomposition, they do not consistently improve cluster
estimation accuracy. Most datasets perform well in the 500–1000
range, with 𝜏= 1000 offering a reliable trade-off. Notably, smaller
values were inadequate for datasets with many clusters, where
the truncated spectrum lacked sufficient resolution to detect the
spectral flattening point.
Optional Normalization Variant. While our core algorithm op-
erates directly on raw cosine similarities, we also performed an
ablation study in which Z-score normalization (followed by rectifi-
cation) was applied prior to Laplacian construction. This step aims
to suppress weak inter-cluster affinities and highlight confident
intra-cluster connections.
We evaluated the impact of Z-score normalization across a range
of moving average window sizes 𝑤∈{3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and subsam-
ple caps 𝜏∈{200, 500, 1000, 2000}. Overall, the Z-score variant
yielded a lower mean relative error (0.6017) compared to the raw
similarity baseline (0.7201), with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test in-
dicating the difference was statistically significant (𝑝< 0.05). At
the dataset level, Z-scoring led to significant improvements on four
out of six datasets, while degrading performance on Reddit and
StackExchange. Given these mixed outcomes, we do not include
normalization in the default pipeline, but offer it as an optional pre-
processing step that may benefit datasets with balanced and seman-
tically well-separated clusters. Appendix B shows heatmaps of raw
and normalized cosine similarity matrices for selected datasets, il-
lustrating that normalization can reveal sharper intra-cluster blocks
and reduce background noise in some cases.
Computational Complexity. We cap each subsample at size 𝜏,
and draw 𝑟= log2(𝑛) · 10 subsets, yielding total complexity 𝑂(𝑟·
𝜏3) = 𝑂(log𝑛· 𝜏3), dominated by the eigendecomposition of 𝜏× 𝜏
similarity matrices. This is substantially more efficient than full
spectral clustering, which incurs 𝑂(𝑛3) time.
Our estimator is modular and algorithm-agnostic, making it suit-
able as a general-purpose 𝑘-estimation module for any clustering
algorithm that benefits from a prior on the number of clusters.
Philosophically, our use of subsampling parallels fast approxi-
mate spectral clustering methods [38], though we apply it to the
problem of estimating 𝑘, not clustering itself. The strong perfor-
mance of our method, particularly its stable relative error in cluster
estimate across dataset sizes (see Section 4.3 for details) supports
its viability as a scalable and reliable 𝑘-estimator.

Extrinsic and Intrinsic Evaluation
We evaluate the effectiveness of parameter-light clustering algo-
rithms on sentence-level embeddings of short texts, comparing their
performance against our proposed 𝑘-estimation method combined
with K-Means and HAC.
3.6.1
Extrinsic Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate clustering perfor-
mance using three standard extrinsic metrics that quantify align-
ment with gold-standard labels:
Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) [28, 32]: Measures
mutual dependence between predicted and true clusters, normalized
to the range [0, 1]. It is equivalent to the V-measure under sym-
metric normalization, which decomposes into homogeneity (each
cluster contains only members of a single class) and completeness
(all members of a class are assigned to the same cluster).
Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) [17]: Quantifies pairwise agree-
ment between clusterings, adjusted for chance. A value of 0 indi-
cates random agreement; 1 indicates perfect alignment.
Fowlkes-Mallows Index (FMI) [14]: Measures the geometric
mean of precision and recall between pairs of points in predicted
and true clusters. Values range from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect
match), with higher values indicating greater consistency between
the predicted and ground-truth clustering structures.
𝑘-Relative Error: Measures the deviation between the estimated
number of clusters ˆ𝑘and the ground-truth count 𝑘:
RE𝑘= | ˆ𝑘−𝑘|
𝑘
3.6.2
Intrinsic Evaluation Metrics. We assess clustering structure
using intrinsic metrics that do not rely on ground-truth labels:
Silhouette Score [29]: Captures both intra-cluster cohesion and
inter-cluster separation. Ranges from −1 to 1, with higher values
indicating more compact and well-separated clusters.
Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) [9]: Computes average similar-
ity between each cluster and its most similar peer. Lower values
indicate better-defined clusters.
Calinski-Harabasz Index (CHI) [6]: Measures the ratio of
between-cluster to within-cluster dispersion. Higher values reflect
more distinct and well-separated clusters.
Cohesion Ratio. We propose a cohesion-based internal metric
that evaluates the average intra-cluster similarity of a clustering
solution relative to the overall similarity structure of the dataset.
The core intuition is that a meaningful clustering should exhibit
stronger internal coherence than the background similarity present
across the entire dataset. Mathematically, this formulation adapts
the Pairwise Discriminative Power (PDP) statistic, originally intro-
duced for supervised product-resolution similarity evaluation [2].
However, our application differs substantially in scope and intent:
whereas PDP is defined with respect to ground-truth equivalence
classes, we employ this ratio purely on the predicted clustering
as a label-free intrinsic index for assessing the quality of cluster-
ings over short-text embeddings. Let 𝑋= {𝑥1, . . . ,𝑥𝑛} be the set of

Nikita Neveditsin, Pawan Lingras, and Vijay Mago
data points, partitioned into clusters C = {𝐶1, . . . ,𝐶𝐾}, where each
𝐶𝑘⊂𝑋is a subset of indices corresponding to a single cluster. Let
𝑆𝑖𝑗denote a general similarity measure between points 𝑥𝑖and 𝑥𝑗;
in our implementation, we use cosine similarity.
We first compute the global average pairwise similarity across
all unordered pairs of points:
𝜇𝐺= 1 𝑛
2

∑︁
1≤𝑖<𝑗≤𝑛
𝑆𝑖𝑗.
Next, we compute the average intra-cluster similarity, denoted 𝜇𝐼,
by summing the similarities between all unordered point pairs
within each cluster and dividing by the total number of such pairs:
𝜇𝐼= 1
𝑃
𝐾
∑︁
𝑘=1
∑︁
𝑖,𝑗∈𝐶𝑘
𝑖<𝑗
𝑆𝑖𝑗,
where 𝑃= Í𝐾
𝑘=1
 |𝐶𝑘|
2
 + 𝑁1, and 𝑁1 is the number of singleton
clusters. Singleton clusters are treated as contributing a default
similarity equal to the global average 𝜇𝐺, and each contributes a
single virtual pair to the total. This treatment ensures that singletons
are neutral in the cohesion calculation, as they neither inflate nor
penalize the score, reflecting their ambiguous contribution to the
overall cluster structure.
The final cohesion ratio is defined as:
𝜌𝐶= 𝜇𝐼
𝜇𝐺
.
Since 𝑆𝑖𝑗∈[0, 1], both 𝜇𝐼and 𝜇𝐺lie in the interval [0, 1]. Therefore,
the Cohesion Ratio 𝜌𝐶= 𝜇𝐼/𝜇𝐺is well-defined and satisfies 𝜌𝐶∈
[0, ∞), with 𝜌𝐶= 1 corresponding to a clustering whose internal
cohesion is equal to the global background similarity. In practice,
most well-formed clusterings yield 𝜌𝐶> 1, while poorly formed or
random clusterings tend to have 𝜌𝐶≈1. This boundedness makes
𝜌𝐶robust and interpretable across datasets with varying structure
and density.
The ratio thus quantifies the relative strength of intra-cluster
similarity compared to the background similarity structure of the
data. It is agnostic to geometric shape, convexity, or distributional
assumptions, making it broadly applicable across a range of domains
and similarity measures.
Theoretical Motivation via an Information-Theoretic Analogy. We
interpret 𝜌𝐶as a proxy for the information gained by conditioning
pairwise affinities on the predicted cluster assignments 𝐶. From a
null-model perspective [17], the global average affinity 𝜇𝐺repre-
sents the expected similarity under random assignments (back-
ground “noise”), while 𝜇𝐼reflects the concentration of affinity
within clusters (signal).
To formalize this contrast, we model the affinity space as a binary
channel with two states (“similar” vs. “not similar”). Let 𝐴∈{0, 1}
denote a Bernoulli random variable indicating whether a randomly
sampled pair is similar, induced from the underlying affinities 𝑆𝑖𝑗. In
this abstraction, we treat the global mean 𝜇𝐺as the prior probability
of similarity, 𝑃(𝐴=1) ≈𝜇𝐺, and the intra-cluster mean 𝜇𝐼as the
conditional probability given cluster agreement, 𝑃(𝐴=1 | 𝐶same) ≈
𝜇𝐼.
The divergence between the cluster-conditioned model and the
background null model can be expressed using the Kullback-Leibler
divergence between two Bernoulli distributions:
𝐷KL(𝜇𝐼∥𝜇𝐺) = 𝜇𝐼log
 𝜇𝐼
𝜇𝐺

+ (1 −𝜇𝐼) log
 1 −𝜇𝐼
1 −𝜇𝐺

.
In the regime typical for short-text clustering, where semantic con-
nections are sparse (𝜇𝐺→0) but clusters are coherent (𝜇𝐼≫𝜇𝐺),
the first term tends to dominate the divergence. This term corre-
sponds to the expected log-likelihood ratio of observing a “similar”
pair under the cluster hypothesis versus the null hypothesis.
Consequently, the logarithm of our Cohesion Ratio corresponds
directly to the Pointwise Mutual Information of this binary event:
log 𝜌𝐶= log
 𝜇𝐼
𝜇𝐺

≈log 𝑃(𝐴=1 | 𝐶same)
𝑃(𝐴=1)
= PMI(𝐴=1,𝐶same).
Under this analogy, 𝜌𝐶≈1 implies PMI ≈0, meaning that condi-
tioning on cluster membership provides no information gain regard-
ing similarity. In contrast, 𝜌𝐶≫1 indicates substantial deviation
from the null, corresponding to meaningful structural information.
Empirically, our results confirm that 𝜌𝐶correlates strongly with ex-
trinsic information-theoretic measures such as normalized mutual
information.

Silhouette Score.

To assess the robustness of clustering performance differences,
we conducted the Nemenyi post-hoc test at a significance level of
𝛼= 0.05. The results indicate that both K-Means and HAC show
statistically significant improvements over several other clustering
algorithms across multiple evaluation metrics. Specifically, for the
F-M score, HAC significantly outperforms all other methods. For
the ARI score and 𝑅𝐸𝑘, HAC significantly outperforms all other
methods except K-Means, with which it shows no significant dif-
ference.
For NMI, Leiden significantly outperforms all other methods. K-
Means and HAC are statistically indistinguishable from each other
and from Affinity Propagation. A deeper analysis of these differ-
ences shows that Affinity Propagation significantly outperforms all

Scalable Parameter-Light Spectral Method for Clustering Short Text Embeddings with a Cohesion-Based Evaluation Metric
other methods in terms of homogeneity, with Leiden ranking sec-
ond, and K-Means and HAC tied for third. The completeness score
shows a different pattern, with K-Means, HAC, and Leiden ranked
first, followed by Affinity Propagation. Notably, the Cohesion Ratio
aligns with the statistical ranking of the Homogeneity score, while
exhibiting moderate concordance with the Completeness score. In
the latter case, HAC emerges as the clear leader, whereas Affinity
Propagation outperforms only OPTICS and HDBSCAN.
For the Silhouette Score, K-Means and HAC are statistically in-
distinguishable from one another and both significantly outperform
all other methods, except in the case where HAC does not differ
significantly from Affinity Propagation. For the Calinski-Harabasz
Index, K-Means significantly outperforms all other methods, with
HAC ranked second.
These findings highlight the consistent and robust performance
of the spectral estimate-based K-Means and HAC methods across
both extrinsic and intrinsic clustering quality measures. Interest-
ingly, Affinity Propagation demonstrates strong performance in
terms of Homogeneity, Cohesion Ratio, and Silhouette Score, but
underperforms on Completeness and exhibits a tendency to se-
verely overestimate the number of clusters, which is reflected in its
moderate extrinsic evaluation scores.
4.2
Correlation Between Extrinsic and Intrinsic
Evaluation Metrics
To further understand the relationship between internal cluster
validity indices and external evaluation measures, we compute
Spearman correlation coefficients across all clustering configura-
tions. The resulting heatmap in Figure 3 illustrates the degree to
which each intrinsic metric aligns with extrinsic clustering quality
scores.
Figure 3: Spearman correlations between intrinsic and ex-
trinsic clustering metrics. Higher values indicate stronger
agreement with extrinsic clustering scores.
The correlation heatmap indicates that, while the Silhouette
Score remains a widely used and effective intrinsic metric, ex-
hibiting strong positive correlations with most extrinsic evaluation
metrics, the proposed Cohesion Ratio demonstrates even greater
alignment in several key areas when applied to clustering of text
representations. In particular, Cohesion Ratio attains the highest
correlation among all intrinsic metrics with Normalized Mutual
Information and Homogeneity, and its correlation with Adjusted
Rand Index is comparable to that of the Silhouette Score. These
findings suggest that, in the context of clustering high-dimensional
textual embeddings, the Cohesion Ratio is not merely a simpler
alternative, but a robust and effective intrinsic metric that exhibits
strong alignment with extrinsic measures grounded in mutual infor-
mation. Interestingly, the Davies-Bouldin Index (negated, as lower
values indicate better clustering) exhibits negative correlations with
most extrinsic metrics. This suggests that DBI may be ill-suited for
evaluating the clustering quality of dense text embeddings, likely
due to its underlying assumption of convex and well-separated
cluster structures, a condition that rarely holds in high-dimensional
text embeddings.
4.3
Relationship Between Predicted Clusters
and True Classes, Scalability of Proposed
Estimator
Figure 4 illustrates the distribution of predicted cluster counts across
stratified datasets for a set of representative clustering algorithms.
Figure 4: Predicted number of clusters (log scale) across strat-
ified datasets for different clustering algorithms. Each box
shows the distribution over multiple runs. Black diamonds
indicate the true number of underlying classes. Our method
tends to produce cluster counts closest to ground truth across
most datasets.
Additional visualizations illustrating how evaluation metrics
vary with the number of clusters are provided in Appendix D. These
plots offer insight into the relatively limited performance of the
estimator on the StackExchange dataset. In particular, the curves
for extrinsic evaluation metrics: ARI and F-M, are comparatively
flat and low, indicating that current embedding models may inade-
quately capture the underlying structure of this dataset. Nonethe-
less, it is noteworthy that the estimated number of clusters closely
corresponds to the peak of the Silhouette score, suggesting that the
estimator remains sensitive to intrinsic structure. Furthermore, the
visual alignment between the Cohesion Ratio and Homogeneity

Nikita Neveditsin, Pawan Lingras, and Vijay Mago
curves provides empirical support for the conceptual relationship
between the Cohesion Ratio and mutual information.
To evaluate robustness to dataset size, we conducted a Kruskal-
Wallis H-test to assess whether the estimated number of clusters us-
ing our method varies significantly across sizes within each dataset
group. The null hypothesis assumes that the estimates come from
the same distribution regardless of dataset size. Our evaluation
spans four dataset groups: DBpedia Title, DBpedia Text, Reddit,
and StackExchange. For each group, we tested our estimator on
stratified subsets ranging from fewer than 1,000 instances to over
300,000 instances. The test returned a p-value of 0.429 for all groups,
indicating no statistically significant difference. This supports the
claim that our proposed estimator is both scalable and robust to
variations in dataset size.

Discussion and Conclusion
In this study, we addressed the challenge of clustering short-text
embeddings in parameter-light settings by proposing and evalu-
ating a scalable method for estimating the number of clusters (𝑘).
Our analysis demonstrates that this spectral estimation technique
is highly effective. When paired with traditional algorithms like Hi-
erarchical Agglomerative Clustering and K-Means, it significantly
outperforms established parameter-light methods across multiple
datasets and evaluation criteria.
Another key contribution of this work is the development and
analysis of the Cohesion Ratio (𝜌𝐶), a simple and interpretable label-
free intrinsic metric with an information-theoretic interpretation
inspired by mutual information. Our findings validate its utility,
showing that it has a stronger correlation with extrinsic metrics like
Normalized Mutual Information and Homogeneity than traditional
indices. These results position the Cohesion Ratio as a robust alter-
native to metrics like the Silhouette Score for assessing clusterings
of high-dimensional text embeddings where ground-truth labels
are absent.
Ultimately, this study provides practitioners with a validated,
data-driven approach for clustering short texts without prior knowl-
edge of 𝑘. The proposed spectral estimation method and the Cohe-
sion Ratio offer powerful tools for the unsupervised organization
and evaluation of textual data, for practitioners faced with clus-
tering short-text data without prior knowledge of the number of
clusters, our findings suggest that using our spectral estimator with
a standard algorithm like HAC or K-Means is a more effective and
robust strategy than relying on popular out-of-the-box parameter-
light methods, paving the way for more robust and interpretable
knowledge discovery.
6
Limitations
First, while we evaluate a diverse range of classical and parameter-
light clustering methods, we do not include recent deep clustering
[37] approaches in our benchmarks. These methods often require
task-specific tuning for pretraining or fine-tuning, which contra-
dicts our core objective: to develop practical, label-free tools for
exploratory clustering of short text.
Second, the ground-truth labels used for extrinsic evaluation
may themselves reflect subjective or task-specific categorizations,
introducing further interpretive variability.
Third, while our estimator performs well across several datasets,
its robustness may depend on factors such as the number of clusters,
cluster granularity, and semantic density. Our current evaluation is
limited to a small set of high-quality short-text datasets, many of
which fall within a narrow cluster range. Broader validation across
more diverse and well-annotated datasets is needed, but further
research is hindered by the limited availability of such resources.
7
Further Research
Future work can advance this study along three complementary
lines. First, clustering objectives could be designed to directly opti-
mize Cohesion Ratio, potentially balanced by auxiliary metrics such
as the Silhouette Score to avoid over-fragmentation. Such objectives
could be explored through heuristic search methods like simulated
annealing [31] or via differentiable relaxations, opening the door
to more intuitive and human-aligned cluster structures. Second,
Cohesion Ratio could be embedded into recent unified clustering
frameworks, such as the density-connectivity distance formula-
tion of Beer et al. [4], enabling parameter-light algorithms that
bridge density-, centroid-, and spectral-based approaches within
a principled formalism. Finally, the proposed spectral 𝑘-estimator
can be developed further in several directions: devising adaptive
mechanisms for selecting smoothing parameters (𝑤,𝜏) based on
stability or information criteria; quantifying estimator uncertainty
with confidence intervals through subsampling or bootstrapping;
improving robustness to different graph constructions (e.g., spar-
sification, normalization, or rectification choices). Together, these
avenues promise both theoretical foundations and practical algo-
rithms for more reliable, interpretable, and parameter-light cluster-
ing in high-dimensional embedding spaces.

Discussion on Cohesion Ratio vs Silhouette Score
While the Cohesion Ratio and the Silhouette Score both aim to quantify intra-cluster cohesion, they rely on fundamentally different
formulations. In the Silhouette Score, cohesion is captured by the pointwise term 𝑎(𝑖), defined as the average distance from a point 𝑥𝑖to all
other points within its assigned cluster:
𝑎(𝑖) =
1
|𝐶𝑘| −1
∑︁
𝑥𝑗∈𝐶𝑘
𝑗≠𝑖
dist(𝑥𝑖,𝑥𝑗),
where 𝐶𝑘denotes the cluster containing 𝑥𝑖, and dist is typically Euclidean distance. This formulation emphasizes the local geometric
compactness of each point’s neighborhood and is sensitive to the shape, size, and boundary structure of individual clusters.
In contrast, the Cohesion Ratio aggregates intra-cluster structure at the global level. Its intra-cluster term 𝜇𝐼is defined as the average
similarity across all unordered pairs of points within the same cluster. Unlike 𝑎(𝑖), 𝜇𝐼is not computed per point and is unaffected by individual
point geometry. It offers a shape-agnostic, distribution-independent summary of global cluster cohesion. This distinction is especially important
for clustering in text embeddings derived from transformer-based models where semantic similarity does not always manifest as compact
geometric clusters. In such spaces, the Silhouette Score may penalize well-formed clusters that are non-convex or overlapping, while the
Cohesion Ratio remains robust to such structures, focusing solely on internal semantic tightness. This makes 𝜌𝐶a more interpretable for
evaluating clustering quality in high-dimensional, meaning-centered domains like natural language.
The Cohesion Ratio can also be interpreted from a null model perspective [17]. The global similarity 𝜇𝐺serves as the expected intra-cluster
similarity under a null clustering model, where cluster assignments are independent of the data distribution. Thus, a ratio 𝜌𝐶> 1 indicates
that the clustering exhibits stronger internal cohesion than would be expected under random assignments, suggesting meaningful structure
beyond chance.

Cohesion Ratio. The computation of the Cohesion Ratio 𝜌𝐶involves two main components: the global similarity 𝜇𝐺and the intra-cluster
similarity 𝜇𝐼.
The global similarity is defined as

 + 𝑁1. In the worst case (e.g., a single cluster), computing 𝜇𝐼also requires O(𝑛2) operations. However, for typical
clusterings with multiple clusters, the number of intra-cluster pairs is substantially smaller, yielding faster runtimes in practice. The overall
complexity for computing 𝜌𝐶is therefore O(𝑛2), though this can be reduced in practice via memoization and parallelism over cluster-level
subcomputations.
Silhouette Score. The worst-case complexity of the Silhouette Score is also O(𝑛2) [29]. However, the pointwise formulation limits
opportunities for vectorization or efficient reuse of intermediate computations.
Comparison. While both metrics have worst-case complexity of O(𝑛2), they differ in computational profile:
• The Cohesion Ratio is computed via a global aggregation over a fixed set of pairs, allowing use of precomputed similarity matrices
and efficient batching or vectorization.
• The Silhouette Score requires pointwise access to intra- and inter-cluster distances, making it more expensive to compute and less
amenable to parallelization.
Consequently, the Cohesion Ratio is typically faster and more scalable in practice, particularly for large datasets with many small clusters
or sparse similarity structures.
