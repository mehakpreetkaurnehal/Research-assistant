Abstract
In high-dimensional statistics, the Lasso is a cornerstone method for simultaneous variable
selection and parameter estimation. However, its reliance on the squared loss function renders
it highly sensitive to outliers and heavy-tailed noise, potentially leading to unreliable model se-
lection and biased estimates. To address this limitation, we introduce the Exponential Lasso, a
novel robust method that integrates an exponential-type loss function within the Lasso frame-
work. This loss function is designed to achieve a smooth trade-oﬀbetween statistical eﬃciency
under Gaussian noise and robustness against data contamination. Unlike other methods that
cap the inﬂuence of large residuals, the exponential loss smoothly redescends, eﬀectively down-
weighting the impact of extreme outliers while preserving near-quadratic behavior for small
errors. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that the Exponential Lasso achieves strong
statistical convergence rates, matching the classical Lasso under ideal conditions while main-
taining its robustness in the presence of heavy-tailed contamination.
Computationally, the
estimator is optimized eﬃciently via a Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm that itera-
tively solves a series of weighted Lasso subproblems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method is highly competitive, outperforming the classical Lasso in contaminated
settings and maintaining strong performance even under Gaussian noise.
Our method is implemented in the R package heavylasso available on Github: https://github.com/tienmt/heavylasso.
Keywords: heavy-tailed noise; Lasso; robust regression; sparsity; soft-thresholding; non-asymptotic

Introduction
In modern data analysis, it is common to encounter datasets where the number of features (p)
greatly exceeds the number of samples (n), a setting that breaks down classical statistical methods.
When faced with this high-dimensionality, the traditional least squares estimator becomes unreliable
and ill-posed. This has spurred the development of regularization methods, which are designed to
impose structure, prevent overﬁtting, and improve the model’s interpretability by favoring simpler,
sparser solutions [11, 3, 9].
A pioneering and widely adopted technique in this domain is the Lasso (least absolute shrinkage
and selection operator) [30]. It provides a powerful framework for performing both variable selection
and parameter estimation simultaneously. The Lasso ﬁnds the coeﬃcient vector β by solving the

following optimization problem:
bβ
lasso = arg min
β∈Rp
 1
2n∥y −Xβ∥2
2 + λ∥β∥1

In this formulation, the ﬁrst term is the standard least squares loss function, while the second is an
L1 penalty weighted by a tuning parameter λ > 0. By penalizing the sum of the absolute values
of the coeﬃcients, the Lasso eﬀectively shrinks many of them to exactly zero, thus performing
automated feature selection. The foundational principles of the Lasso have ignited a vast body of
research, leading to numerous advancements in sparse estimation and high-dimensional inference
[38, 4, 36, 20, 2].
However, the squared loss underlying the classical Lasso implicitly assumes light-tailed, approx-
imately Gaussian errors. In many real-world datasets—such as those arising in genomics, ﬁnance,
and environmental monitoring—this assumption is frequently violated. Outliers or heavy-tailed
noise can exert a disproportionate inﬂuence on the squared loss, leading to biased estimates and
poor variable selection performance [17, 19]. To mitigate such sensitivity, numerous robust variants
of the Lasso have been proposed, often by replacing the squared loss with more robust alternatives
such as the Huber loss [26, 17, 18], Tukey’s biweight loss [5, 28], Student’s loss [22], or rank-based
and median-of-means losses [24, 15, 32]. These methods reduce the impact of extreme residuals but
may introduce additional tuning complexity or require nontrivial optimization schemes when the
loss becomes nonconvex.
In this work, we consider a novel robust loss function—the exponential-type loss—within the
Lasso penalization framework, designed to achieve a smooth trade-oﬀbetween eﬃciency under
Gaussian noise and robustness under heavy-tailed contamination. The proposed estimator, termed
the Exponential Lasso, is deﬁned as

,
where τ > 0 controls the degree of robustness. When τ →0, the exponential loss approaches
the squared loss, recovering the classical Lasso.
For ﬁnite τ, large residuals are exponentially
downweighted, eﬀectively limiting their inﬂuence on parameter estimation.
The intuition behind this exponential-type loss is simple yet powerful: it penalizes small residuals
nearly quadratically—preserving statistical eﬃciency under light-tailed noise—while suppressing
the contribution of extreme deviations through the exponential term. In contrast to the Huber
loss, which caps the linear growth of large residuals, the exponential loss smoothly redescends,
assigning progressively smaller weights to extreme outliers. This property aligns with the inﬂuence-
function perspective in robust statistics [10], where bounded and redescending functions provide
strong resistance to contamination. As a result, the Exponential Lasso achieves both robustness
and diﬀerentiability, enabling eﬃcient optimization and stability in high-dimensional regimes.
From a computational standpoint, the exponential loss admits a natural Majorization–Minimization
(MM) algorithmic interpretation. Each iteration reweights the residuals according to their expo-
nential downweighting factor, leading to a sequence of weighted Lasso subproblems. This results in
a fast, stable, and interpretable algorithm with minimal modiﬁcation to standard Lasso solvers.
Our theoretical results establishe that the proposed Exponential Lasso estimator achieves reli-
able estimation accuracy even in high-dimensional settings and under the presence of outliers or
heavy-tailed noise. The theoretical result guarantees that, with an appropriate choice of the tuning
2

parameter, the estimator attains the same convergence rate as the classical Lasso under ideal con-
ditions. This robustness is ensured under a mild assumption on the noise distribution, requiring
only that the errors have a positive probability of lying within a central region rather than hav-
ing light tails. The proof combines a local curvature argument showing that the exponential loss
remains well-behaved near the true parameter with concentration techniques that control random
ﬂuctuations in the data [17, 18].
To demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive simulation studies under
a variety of settings involving heavy-tailed noise and outliers. We compare our approach to several
Lasso variants that employ diﬀerent loss functions, including the squared loss [30], ℓ1 loss [31], Huber
loss [35] and Student’s loss [22].
The simulation results indicate that our method consistently
exhibits strong empirical performance relative to these alternatives, particularly in challenging
settings with non-Gaussian errors or contaminated by outliers. Moreover, our proposed method
outperforms classical Lasso even in the Gaussian noise. In addition to simulations, we present real
data applications that further supports the utility of our approach. Numerical results show that
our proposed method are very competitive and promising.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the proposed methodol-
ogy alongside the Exponential Lasso approach and provides theoretical insights into the robustness
properties of the loss function.
This section also establishes non-asymptotic statistical guaran-
tees for the proposed estimator. Section 3 details the algorithmic implementation and includes a
convergence analysis of the proposed optimization scheme. Simulation studies evaluating empirical
performance are presented in Section 4. Applications to two real datasets are discussed in Section 5.
Finally, concluding remarks and discussions are provided in Section 6, while all technical proofs are
collected in Appendix A.

Model and method
2.1
Robust Lasso with Exponential-type loss
Let {(xi, yi)}n
i=1 denote a collection of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) observations
arising from the linear model
yi = x⊤
i β∗+ ǫi,
(1)
where xi ∈Rp is the i-th row of the design matrix X and β∗∈Rp is the unknown vector of regression
coeﬃcients that we seek to estimate. The condition on the random noise is given below in which
we consider a very wild class of noise that cover both heavy-tailed noise and outlier contaminated
models.
Let
Lτ(β) = 1

ℓτ(yi −x⊤

where
ℓτ(r) = 1

.
(2)
We consider the following robust penalized regression estimator, called Exponential Lasso:
bβ := arg min
β∈Rp {Lτ(β) + λ∥β∥1} ,
(3)
where τ > 0 controls the degree of robustness and λ > 0 is a regularization parameter. For small
τ, the loss approximates the quadratic loss and (3) reduces to the standard Lasso. For larger τ, the
exponential term strongly downweights large residuals, thus providing robustness against outliers.

2.2
Robustness of the loss
Some intuitions:
One can explicitly show the connection to the standard Lasso. The exponential
loss ℓτ(r) can be analyzed using a Taylor expansion for ex around 0. Let u = −τ
2 r2. Since eu ≈1+u
for small u:
ℓτ(r) = 1

2r2.
This formally demonstrates that as τ →0, your objective function Lτ(β) converges to the standard
least-squares loss, and thus bβ converges to the classical Lasso estimator. This highlights that our
proposed method is a natural generalization of the classical Lasso. See Figure 1 for a detailed
visualization comparison between diﬀerent losses: squared loss, Tukey’s biweight loss, absolute (ℓ1)
loss, and Huber loss. The plot illustrates that, unlike Huber loss, our loss is much less sensitive to
large residuals while closely resembling the squared loss for small residual values.
The Inﬂuence Function:
A key concept in robust statistics is the inﬂuence function [10], which
measures the eﬀect of an inﬁnitesimal outlier on the estimator. The inﬂuence function is propor-
tional to the ﬁrst derivative of the loss function, ψ(r) = ℓ′
τ(r), where
ψ(r) = ∂
∂r
1
τ

1 −e−τ
2 r2
= re−τ
2 r2.
• The inﬂuence function is bounded: The maximum value of |r exp (−τ
2r2)| is ﬁnite.
This
contrasts with the L2 loss, where ψ(r) = r, which is unbounded. An unbounded inﬂuence
function means a single large outlier can have an arbitrarily large (i.e., inﬁnite) inﬂuence on
the estimate.
• It is redescending: As the residual r →∞(a gross outlier), the inﬂuence ψ(r) →0. This
is a very strong form of robustness. The estimator completely ignores data points that are
suﬃciently far from the bulk of the data. This is an advantage over other robust losses like the
Huber loss, whose inﬂuence function is bounded but not redescending (it becomes constant,
ψ(r) = sign(r) · k, for large r).
Other insights:
The proposed loss function can also be viewed as a correntropy or Welsch-type
loss that downweights large residuals through an exponential kernel, thereby enhancing robustness
against outliers, which is known in the robust signal-processing literature [16, 12] .
Moreover,
from an information-theoretic perspective, it is also closely connected to the α-divergence, where
τ acts analogously to the divergence parameter controlling the trade-oﬀbetween eﬃciency and
robustness [14, 25].
This dual interpretation highlights the method’s grounding in both robust
estimation and divergence-based statistical learning. We also note that similar exponential-type loss
functions have been explored in prior studies as in [33, 29, 34], where the loss takes the form ℓτ(t) =
1 −e−t2/τ. In contrast, our proposed formulation is more directly connected to the α-divergence
family. Furthermore, while the aforementioned works primarily address low-dimensional settings
and provide asymptotic analyses, our study focuses on high-dimensional regimes and establishes
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees.

Statistical guarantee
We now demonstrate that, under suitable assumptions, our Exponential-Lasso method achieves
strong non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees comparable to those established for the Huber loss.
We make the following assumptions.
Assumption 1 (Design and sparsity). We assume that:
a). The rows xi ∈Rp are non-random or random but satisfy ∥xi∥∞≤K almost surely for a
known constant K > 0.
b). Let β∗be the true parameter with support S = supp(β∗) and sparsity s := |S| < n < p.
c). There exists φmin > 0 and a radius r > 0 such that for all ∆∈Rp with ∥∆∥2 ≤r and
∥∆Sc∥1 ≤3∥∆S∥1,

n

i=1

2.
Assumption 2 (Noise). The errors εi are i.i.d. with the following properties:
(i). εi are symmetric about 0.
(ii). There exists a constant c ∈(0, 1/√τ) and p0 := P(|εi| ≤c) > 0.
Remarks: symmetry can be relaxed by replacing the centering step with the population bias, but
symmetry keeps statements concise. The choice c < 1/√τ ensures positive curvature of the per-
observation second derivative inside |r| ≤c.

Discussion on noise assumptions.
The noise conditions assumed above are notably weaker
than the conventional sub-Gaussian or even sub-exponential assumptions often imposed in high-
dimensional regression analysis. In particular, condition (ii) only requires that the noise distribution
has some probability mass around zero, ensuring that the majority of samples are not dominated
by extreme outliers, while symmetry guarantees that the noise has zero median.
No moment
or exponential tail condition is imposed, allowing the framework to accommodate a broad class
of heavy-tailed or contamination models, such as Student’s t distributions with small degrees of
freedom or Huber error models of the form
εi ∼(1 −π) N(0, σ2) + π G,
where G may represent a heavy-tailed or outlier-generating component (e.g., Cauchy or Laplace).
Therefore, this assumption captures realistic data-generating mechanisms with occasional large
deviations, while retaining suﬃcient regularity for establishing estimation error bounds. It is thus
particularly suitable for robust (penalized) regression models designed to handle impulsive noise or
mild contamination in the observations.

The theoretical analysis is based on the Local Restricted Strong Convexity (LRSC) condition,
with a full proof provided in Appendix A. The methodology largely adopts the general framework
proposed in [17, 18], and as such, our results parallel those obtained for the Huber-loss Lasso. The
primary contribution of our approach is the reliance on a substantially weaker noise condition, as
we do not assume the existence of any moments for the noise distribution.

Majorization–Minimization Algorithm
3.1
Algorithm development
The exponential-type loss in (3) is nonconvex but smooth. To derive an eﬃcient iterative algorithm,
we adopt a majorization–minimization (MM) approach. Let us deﬁne for each observation
ℓi(β) = 1
τ

2ri(β)2 

ri(β) = yi −x⊤
i β.
Consider the function φ(u) = 1 −exp(−τ
2u) for u ≥0. Since φ′′(u) = −( τ
2)2 exp(−τ
2u) < 0, the
function φ is concave. For any ﬁxed u(t), the ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion provides a global upper
bound (a tight majorizer):
φ(u) ≤φ(u(t)) + φ′(u(t))(u −u(t)),
∀u ≥0.
(6)
Substituting ui = ri(β)2 and summing over i yields the following upper bound for the empirical
loss:

acts as an adaptive weight. Minimizing the right-hand side of the above inequality thus deﬁnes the
MM update.
Given the current estimate β(t), the MM procedure alternates between updating the weights
v(t)

according to (8) and solving a weighted Lasso subproblem:
• (Step 1) Compute residuals r(t)

i = 1, . . . , n.
These weights downweight observations with large residuals, thereby reducing the inﬂuence
of outliers.
• (Step 2) Update the regression coeﬃcients by solving the weighted Lasso problem

The above two steps are repeated until convergence, e.g., until ∥β(t+1) −β(t)∥2/(1+∥β(t)∥2) < ε
for a small tolerance ε > 0. Step 2 can be eﬃciently implemented using standard coordinate-descent
algorithms or existing Lasso solvers (e.g., glmnet in R) by specifying the observation weights {v(t)
i }.

3.2
Coordinate descent updates using soft-thresholding
We estimate the regression coeﬃcients in (9) via a coordinate descent algorithm. Let denote the
residual vector at iteration t as
r(t) = y −Xβ(t) .
For the j-th coordinate, we deﬁne the
corresponding partial residual — that is, the residual excluding the contribution of variable j — as
rj = r(t) + Xjβ(t)
j .
The objective function restricted to the single coeﬃcient βj can then be expressed as:
1
2n
n
X
i=1
vi(rij −xijβj)2 + λ|βj|.
Minimization of this univariate problem yields a closed-form update via the soft-thresholding op-

Discussion.
The proposed algorithm can be viewed as an EM-like procedure, where the weights
{v(t)
i } play a role analogous to latent variables that reﬂect the reliability of each observation. As
τ →0, all v(t)
i
→1, and the algorithm reduces to the ordinary Lasso. For larger τ, the exponential
decay of v(t)

produces strong robustness to large residuals.

L(β) := 1
n
n
X
i=1
ℓi(β),
so F(β) = L(β) + λ∥β∥1.
We ﬁrst show that the MM iterates produce a monotone decreasing sequence of objective values
and remain in a bounded level set.
Theorem 2 (Monotone decrease and boundedness). Assume that each row xi satisﬁes ∥xi∥2 < ∞.
Let {β(t)} be the sequence produced by Algorithm 1 where in each M-step we compute an exact
minimizer of the surrogate Q(t)(β) in (9). Then:
(i). (Descent) The sequence of objective values {F(β(t))} is nonincreasing: F(β(t+1)) ≤F(β(t)), ∀t ≥
0.
(ii). (Lower bounded) F(β) ≥0 for all β, hence {F(β(t))} converges to a ﬁnite limit F ⋆.
(iii). (Bounded iterates) The iterates {β(t)} lie in the sublevel set {β : F(β) ≤F(β(0))}, which is
bounded under the mild condition that λ > 0 or that X has full column rank; hence {β(t)} is
bounded.
Next we establish that any accumulation point of the MM iterates is a stationary point of
the nonconvex objective F(β). Because F contains the nondiﬀerentiable ℓ1 term, stationarity is
understood in the subgradient/KKT sense.
Theorem 3 (Cluster points are stationary). Let assume that each row xi satisﬁes ∥xi∥2 < ∞and
let {β(t)} be generated by Algorithm 1 with exact M-steps (exact minimizer of the surrogate). Then
every limit point β⋆of {β(t)} is a stationary point of F, i.e. 0 ∈∇L(β⋆) + λ∂∥β⋆∥1. Consequently,
the whole sequence has its set of cluster points contained in the set of stationary points of F.
Corollary 1 (Convergence of objective and subsequential stationarity). Under the hypotheses of
Theorems 2–3, the objective values F(β(t)) converge to a ﬁnite F ⋆and every cluster point of {β(t)}
is a stationary point of F. If, in addition, the set of stationary points at level F ⋆is ﬁnite and the
sequence has a unique cluster point, then β(t) →β⋆.
The objective F(β) is nonconvex because L(β) is nonconvex; therefore MM can only be expected
to converge to a local stationary point in general. Uniqueness of the weighted Lasso minimizer in
each M-step holds when X⊤˜V (t)X is positive deﬁnite (e.g. full column rank and all ˜v(t)
i
> 0). In
practice ˜v(t)
i
∈(0, 1], so strict positive deﬁniteness reduces to conditions on X.

3.4
Tuning the regularization parameter λ
We select the regularization parameter λ in the exponential Lasso method primarily using K-fold
cross-validation (CV), which serves as the default option.
Cross-validation evaluates predictive
performance by partitioning the data into training and validation folds and choosing the λ that
minimizes the average prediction error. This provides a practical, data-driven balance between
model sparsity and predictive accuracy.
Our method is implemented in the R package heavylasso available on Github: https://github.com/tienmt/heavyla

Simulation studies
4.1
Setup
Compared methods
The central aim of this simulation is to evaluate how diﬀerent robust loss functions aﬀect the
performance of the Lasso estimator. Accordingly, our investigation is strictly focused on regression
methods that incorporate the Lasso penalty, to the exclusion of other regularization approaches.
The following four estimators are included in our comparative analysis:
• Classical Lasso, which minimizes a squared loss function, implemented in the R package glmnet
[8].
• Huber Lasso, which employs the hybrid Huber loss function.
• LAD Lasso, which is based on the ℓ1 loss function. Both the LAD and Huber variants are
implemented in the R package hqreg.
• Heavy Lasso, which utilizes a Student loss function, available in the R package heavylasso
[22].
Simulation settings
In our data generation process, the predictors Xi follow a N(0, Σ) distribution. We investigate two
speciﬁc covariance scenarios: (i) an identity matrix (Σ = Ip), representing independent predictors,
and (ii) an autoregressive correlation structure (Σij = ρ|i−j|
X
).
The ground-truth vector β0 is s-sparse, with the s non-zero coeﬃcients split evenly, taking values
of 1 (for s/2 entries) and −1 (for the remaining s/2 entries). The responses yi are then produced
via the linear model (1) under the following noise conditions:
• Gaussian noise, ǫi ∼N(0, 1). This serves as a baseline to assess how various robust methods
perform under ideal (light-tailed) conditions.
• Gaussian noise with large variance. ǫi ∼N(0, 32). This setting introduces moderate heavy-
tailed behavior through increased variance.
• Student noise. ǫi ∼t3. This case represents heavy-tailed noise with ﬁnite variance.
10

• Cauchy noise. ǫi ∼Cauchy. This represents a more extreme heavy-tailed setting with inﬁnite
variance.
• Contaminated with outliers. ǫi ∼N(0, 1) or ǫi ∼t3 but some portion of the observed responses
are further contaminated by outliers. This setting evaluates robustness to contamination.
We assessed the performance of each method from three diﬀerent angles: parameter estimation,
prediction on new data, and variable selection accuracy. We used two metrics to evaluate how
accurately each model estimated the true coeﬃcients.
First, we measured the estimation error
using the squared ℓ2 norm, which calculates the distance between the estimated coeﬃcients (bβ) and
the true coeﬃcients (β0):
∥bβ −β0∥2
2. Second, we evaluated the error in the model’s ﬁtted values
on the training data, captured by the linear predictor error:
ℓ(X⊤β0) := 1
n∥X⊤(bβ −β0)∥2
2
To measure prediction accuracy, we calculated the mean squared prediction error (MSPE) on a
large, independent test set. This test set, (Xtest, ytest), was generated from the same model as the
training data, with a ﬁxed size of ntest = 5000. The MSPE is deﬁned as:
MSPEtest :=
1
ntest
ntest
X
i=1

ytest,i −X⊤
test,i bβ
2
.
Finally, we assessed each method’s ability to correctly identify the relevant predictors in the model.
This was measured using two standard metrics: the True Positive Rate (TPR) and the False
Discovery Rate (FDR).
Each simulation setting is repeated 100 times, and we report the mean and standard deviation
of the results. The outcomes are presented in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. The regularized parameters
for all ﬁve methods are selected via 5-fold cross-validation. The tuning parameter τ in our method
is set to 0.1, which is motivated from sensitivity analysis in Subsection 4.2.3 below.

Simulations results
4.2.1
Results with Heavy-tailed noises
We ﬁrst examine the performance of our method against competing approaches across several noise
settings. This comparison is conducted in two distinct regimes: a small scale setting with p = 120
and n = 100 (Tables 1, 2), and a medium scale setting with p = 500 and n = 300 (Tables 3, 4).
The true sparsity s∗is ﬁxed at 10 for all experiments.
In both settings, particularly under Gaussian noise, our proposed method and the Heavy Lasso
are shown to be highly competitive. They frequently outperform the classical Lasso, a level of
performance not attained by the Huber Lasso or the L1 Lasso in these experiments. The robustness
and superiority of these results appear to improve in the larger-scale data scenarios, as evidenced
in Tables 3 and 4.
A general observation is that our proposed method and the Heavy Lasso, both being non-convex,
tend to return more small non-zero coeﬃcients. This characteristic typically leads to a higher false
positive rate (or false discovery rate) when compared to convex alternatives like the Huber Lasso
or the L1 Lasso. Despite this, a crucial advantage is their ability to consistently select the true
support.
11

When considering heavy-tailed noise, such as the Student’s t3 or Cauchy distributions, our
proposed method and the Heavy Lasso invariably provide the best results regarding both estimation
and prediction errors. More particularly, in the challenging Cauchy noise scenario, our method
demonstrates clear superiority across all metrics, including estimation, prediction, and variable
selection accuracy.
4.2.2
Results with Outliers
We next evaluate the behavior of all considered methods in the presence of outliers.
For this
purpose, we ﬁx the simulation parameters at p = 500, s∗= 10, and n = 300. We investigate two
underlying noise distributions: standard normal, N(0, 1), and Student’s t3. The proportion of the
response data contaminated by outliers is varied among 10%, 20%, and 30%. The results of this
analysis are presented in Table 5.
The results indicate that our proposed method outperforms both the Huber Lasso and the
L1 Lasso. As expected, the classical Lasso breaks down entirely under these conditions. When
the underlying noise is Gaussian, our method is signiﬁcantly better than the Heavy Lasso (which
utilizes a Student’s loss). This performance gap is particularly pronounced when a larger fraction
of the responses are contaminated, for example, at the 30% level. In the presence of Student’s t3
noise, the Heavy Lasso exhibits a slight advantage at lower contamination levels. However, as the
contamination fraction increases to 30%, our proposed method once again outperforms the Heavy
Lasso. These ﬁndings clearly highlight the superior robustness of our proposed methodology.
4.2.3
On sensitivity of tuning parameter τ
To evaluate the sensitivity of our proposed method to the tuning parameter τ, we conducted a
dedicated simulation study. We ﬁxed the problem dimensions at p = 120, s∗= 10, and n = 100,
while varying τ over the grid {0.001, 0.1, 1, 10}.
The results, averaged over 100 replications under various noise distributions and outlier settings,
are presented in Table 6. This analysis demonstrates that τ = 0.1 consistently yields the best and
most stable performance. Based on this ﬁnding, we adopted τ = 0.1 as the ﬁxed value for this
hyperparameter in all other experiments and the real-data application.
4.3
Results with increasing sparsity
We further investigate how the sparsity level (s∗) inﬂuences the performance of the various methods
under conditions of heavy-tailed noise and outliers. In this analysis, we ﬁxed the dimensionality
at p = 500 and n = 300 with independent predictors (Σ = Ip). We then vary the true sparsity s∗
across the values {4, 8, 16}.
The averaged results from 100 simulation repetitions, presented in Table 7, conﬁrm that all
methods exhibit a natural increase in both estimation and prediction errors as the sparsity increases.
Crucially, our proposed method consistently maintains its position as the top performer across all
sparsity levels in terms of both error metrics. The superiority of our method is most pronounced
in the highly sparse setting where s∗= 16, where it signiﬁcantly outperforms all other considered
approaches. This comprehensive test demonstrates that the robustness of our method extends not
only to non-Gaussian noise but also to increased model complexity due to higher sparsity.

Application examples with real data
5.1
Analyzing cancer cell line NCI-60 data
We evaluate the proposed method using the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel, a benchmark dataset
widely used in genomic and proteomic modeling studies [23]. A pre-processed version of the data,
available in the R package robustHD [1], was employed in our analysis. The dataset comprises
n = 59 human cancer cell lines, each characterized by gene and protein expression measurements.
One sample with missing gene expression values was excluded from the analysis.
The gene expression data form a matrix with 22,283 features, while the protein expression data
consist of 162 features measured using reverse-phase protein lysate arrays. The protein data were
log2-transformed and standardized to have zero mean, following the preprocessing steps in [1]. This
dataset provides a rich setting for studying the relationship between high-dimensional genomic
proﬁles and proteomic responses. Consistent with prior work, we model protein 92 as the response
variable and select the 300 gene expression features exhibiting the highest marginal correlations
with it to form the predictor matrix.
For model evaluation, nine samples were randomly set aside as a test set, and the remaining 50
samples were used for model training. This random partitioning was repeated 100 times, and the
mean squared prediction error (MSPE) on the held-out test data was averaged across replications.
Table 8 summarizes the results.

Our proposed estimator and the heavy-tailed Lasso based on Student’s loss achieved the lowest
prediction errors, indicating superior robustness to outliers and noise.
Methods employing the
Huber and ℓ1 losses also outperformed the standard Lasso with the squared loss.
In terms of
variable selection, all ﬁve methods consistently identiﬁed one common predictor (gene ID 8502),
highlighting its potential biological relevance.

Analyzing gene expression TRIM32 data
In this application, we conduct an analysis using high-dimensional genomics data from [27]. The
study by [27] involved analyzing RNA from the eyes of 120 twelve-week-old male rats, using 31,042
diﬀerent probe sets.
Our focus is on modeling the expression of the gene TRIM32, as it was
identiﬁed by [6] as a gene associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a condition that includes retinal
degeneration among its symptoms. Since [27] observed that many probes were not expressed in the
eye, we follow the approach of [13] and [21], limiting our analysis to the 500 genes with the highest
absolute Pearson correlation with TRIM32 expression. The data for this analysis is available from
the R package abess, [37].
To assess the methods, we randomly allocate 84 of the 120 samples for training and the remaining
36 for testing, maintaining an approximate 70/30 percent of the data split.
The methods are
executed using the training set, and their prediction accuracy is evaluated on the test set. This

of these iterations are displayed in Table 9.
For this data set, we see that Huber and L1 Lasso methods return higher prediction errors
compared to the standard lasso. On the other hand, our proposed method and heavy lasso method
are the best methods. In terms of variable selection, all ﬁve methods consistently identiﬁed six
common predictors 1371614, 1375833, 1377836, 1388491, 1389910, 1393736, highlighting its

Discussion and Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced the Exponential Lasso, a novel robust estimator for high-dimensional
linear regression. Our goal was to address the well-known sensitivity of the classical Lasso’s squared-
error loss to outliers and heavy-tailed noise. By replacing the squared loss with an exponential-type
loss function, our method successfully integrates the L1 penalty for sparse estimation with the
principles of robust M-estimation, as the loss function smoothly and automatically downweights
the inﬂuence of large residuals.
From a theoretical standpoint, we established strong non-asymptotic guarantees, proving that
the Exponential Lasso achieves reliable estimation accuracy, matching the standard Lasso or Huber

Lasso but under much milder assumptions that permit heavy-tailed noise. Computationally, the
estimator’s smooth and non-convex objective function is well-suited for a Majorization-Minimization
(MM) algorithm. This framework is stable and eﬃcient, iteratively solving a sequence of reweighted
Lasso problems. Empirically, our extensive simulations demonstrated that the Exponential Lasso
consistently outperforms competitors like the classical, L1 (LAD), and Huber Lasso, especially in
settings with signiﬁcant data contamination. Notably, it remained highly competitive even under
standard Gaussian noise, suggesting a “premium” for its robustness. Our real-data application
further validated these ﬁndings, conﬁrming its practical relevance.
The primary advantage of the Exponential Lasso lies in its unique balance of eﬃciency and
robustness. However, the method introduces the practical challenge of tuning two parameters: the
regularization parameter λ and the robustness parameter τ. Developing a data-driven, computa-
tionally eﬃcient strategy for this joint tuning is a critical next step. Furthermore, the objective
function’s non-convexity means our MM algorithm guarantees convergence to only a stationary
point, not necessarily the global optimum.
These limitations point toward clear avenues for future research. A more comprehensive study
of parameter tuning is essential for broad practical adoption. Additionally, exploring initialization
strategies or alternative global optimization algorithms could further bolster the method against
the challenges of non-convexity. Finally, the robust exponential loss framework is highly adaptable.
It could be extended to other high-dimensional problems, such as the Group Lasso, the Elastic Net,

Proof of Theorem 1.
Step A — Optimality and cone decomposition.
The estimator bβ satisﬁes, through its optimality deﬁnition,
Lτ(bβ) + λ∥bβ∥1 ≤Lτ(β∗) + λ∥β∗∥1.
Set ∆:= bβ −β∗. Rearranging and using the standard bound ∥β∗∥1 −∥β∗+∆∥1 ≤∥∆S∥1 −∥∆Sc∥1
yields
Lτ(β∗+ ∆) −Lτ(β∗) ≤λ

Let G = {i : |εi| ≤c/2}. If ∥∆∥2 ≤r and r is small enough so that |x⊤
i ∆| ≤c/2 for all i, then
for any i ∈G we have |ξi| ≤c and hence ψ′

Therefore with the choice λ in (4) we have ∥∇Lτ(β∗)∥∞≤λ/4.

2 ≤λ(∥∆S∥1 −∥∆Sc∥1).

where the last inequality is numeric (one may sharpen constants; we keep a conservative factor 12
to account for small-sample Bernstein second-order terms). The bound on ℓ1-error follows from the
cone relation: ∥∆Sc∥1 ≤3∥∆S∥1, which implies ∥∆∥1 ≤4∥∆S∥1 ≤4√s∥∆∥2.
Step E — Probability union.
The two high-probability events used are:
• gradient sup-norm event: probability at least 1 −δ;
• good indices proportion event: probability at least 1 −exp(−np2
0/8).
21

Union bound gives the claimed probability 1 −δ −exp(−np2
0/8). (We wrote 1 −δ −2 exp(−np2
0/8)
in the theorem to be conservative in accounting for other small-probability concentration steps; the
constants may be tightened.)
This completes the proof of Theorem 1.
Proof of Theorem 2. Point (i): By construction of the majorizer, for any β,
L(β) ≤Q(t)(β) −λ∥β∥1 + C(t).
Because Q(t)(·) coincides with L(·) + λ∥· ∥1 at β = β(t) (the majorizer is tight at the expansion
point), we have Q(t)(β(t)) = F(β(t)). Let β(t+1) be the minimizer of Q(t). Then
F(β(t+1)) ≤Q(t)(β(t+1)) ≤Q(t)(β(t)) = F(β(t)).
The ﬁrst inequality follows from L(·) ≤surrogate −C(t); the second because β(t+1) minimizes Q(t).
This proves the descent property.
Point (ii): Since ℓi(β) ≥0 for all i and λ∥β∥1 ≥0, we have F(β) ≥0. From point (i) the
nonincreasing bounded-below sequence F(β(t)) converges to some ﬁnite limit F ⋆≥0.
Point (iii): Because F(β(t)) ≤F(β(0)) for all t, all iterates belong to the sublevel set {β : F(β) ≤
F(β(0))}. If λ > 0, then ∥β∥1 ≤F(β(0))/λ on this sublevel set, which implies boundedness. If λ = 0
and X has full column rank, then the loss L(β) is coercive (grows at least quadratically) and hence
the sublevel set is bounded. Thus under these mild alternatives the iterates are bounded.
Proof of Theorem 3. Let β(tk) →β⋆be any convergent subsequence; such subsequences exist
because {β(t)} is bounded. Denote by ˜v(t)
i
= exp(−τ
2 ri(β(t))2) the weights used in the surrogate at
step t. Because the mapping β 7→˜vi(β) is continuous, ˜v(tk)
i
→˜v⋆
i := exp(−τ
2ri(β⋆)2) as k →∞for
each i.
By the optimality of β(tk+1) for the convex surrogate Q(tk) we have the KKT condition for the
weighted Lasso:
0 ∈−1
nX⊤  ˜V (tk)(y −Xβ(tk+1))

+ λ∂∥β(tk+1)∥1,
(13)
where ˜V (tk) = diag(˜v(tk)
1
, . . . , ˜v(tk)
n
). Rearranging,
1
nX⊤˜V (tk)(y −Xβ(tk+1)) ∈λ∂∥β(tk+1)∥1.
Because β(tk+1) and ˜V (tk) are bounded and the functions are continuous, passing to the limit
along the subsequence yields
1
nX⊤˜V ⋆(y −Xβ⋆) ∈λ∂∥β⋆∥1.
It remains to show that the limiting left-hand side equals ∇L(β⋆). Direct diﬀerentiation of L(β)
gives
∇L(β) = −1

so indeed
−∇L(β⋆) = 1
nX⊤˜V ⋆(y −Xβ⋆).
Combining with the limit KKT condition gives 0 ∈∇L(β⋆) + λ∂∥β⋆∥1, i.e. β⋆is stationary for
F.
