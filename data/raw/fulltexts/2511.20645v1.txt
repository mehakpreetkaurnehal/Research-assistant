Abstract: Latent-space modeling has been the standard for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). However, it relies on a two-stage pipeline
where the pretrained autoencoder introduces lossy reconstruction, leading to error accumulation while hindering joint optimization.
To address these issues, we propose PixelDiT, a single-stage, end-to-end model that eliminates the need for the autoencoder and
learns the diffusion process directly in the pixel space. PixelDiT adopts a fully transformer-based architecture shaped by a dual-level
design: a patch-level DiT that captures global semantics and a pixel-level DiT that refines texture details, enabling efficient training of
a pixel-space diffusion model while preserving fine details. Our analysis reveals that effective pixel-level token modeling is essential
to the success of pixel diffusion. PixelDiT achieves 1.61 FID on ImageNet 256×256, surpassing existing pixel generative models
by a large margin. We further extend PixelDiT to text-to-image generation and pretrain it at the 10242 resolution in pixel space. It
achieves 0.74 on GenEval and 83.5 on DPG-bench, approaching the best latent diffusion models.

FLUX [2] and Stable Diffusion 3 [3] produce severe and non-invertible distortions on the small details such as the scene texts on the
wall, therefore the subsequent editing of the latent diffusion models fails. In contrast, by denoising directly in pixel space without a
VAE, our PixelDiT avoids VAE reconstruction artifacts and helps maintain background consistency during local manipulations. For a
fair comparison, all models are evaluated with nmin= 0 in FlowEdit to preserve more structures.

PixelDiT: Pixel Diffusion Transformers for Image Generation
1. Introduction
Latent diffusion models (LDMs) [4] perform denoising in
a compressed representation space and have become the
standard paradigm for Diffusion Transformers [5, 6]. This
choice yields substantial savings in compute and mem-
ory. However, it also inherits two structural limitations.
First, LDMs couple diffusion to a separately pretrained au-
toencoder whose reconstruction objective is only partially
aligned with the downstream generative objective [7, 8].
Second, the autoencoder introduces a lossy reconstruction
that can remove high-frequency details and cap sample
fidelity for image generation and editing tasks even when
the diffusion model is strong [3, 9, 10, 11], as shown in
Figure 1b. These limitations motivate us to revisit pixel-
space diffusion, where both learning and sampling operate
directly in the original pixels without autoencoders.
The core challenge in pixel-space diffusion can be framed
as pixel modeling. By pixel modeling, we refer to the
mechanism of capturing dense, per-pixel interactions and
high-frequency details, which is distinct from the semantic
structural generation typically handled by coarse patch
tokens. Effectively modeling these per-pixel tokens is
crucial for texture fidelity but computationally expensive.
Prior attempts expose a fundamental trade-off in how pixel
interactions are organized. One line of work adopts aggres-
sive patchification [12, 13, 14, 15, 16] to keep attention
affordable, but this significantly weakens per-pixel token
modeling and hinders the generation of finer visual con-
tents. Another line pushes toward near-pixel granularity
(e.g., small patch sizes or U-ViT-like designs) to better
preserve details [17, 18, 19], but the global attention must
process very long token sequences with quadratic complex-
ity, or rely on heavy decoder-style stacks, resulting in high
training and sampling costs. Cascaded pipelines [20, 21]
mitigate some cost, but may introduce additional stages
and accumulated errors. Taken together, these observa-
tions suggest that the obstacle to practical pixel-space
diffusion is the lack of an efficient pixel modeling mecha-
nism that can model both global semantics and per-pixel
updates.
To address these challenges, we propose PixelDiT, a single-
stage, fully transformer-based diffusion model that per-
forms end-to-end training and sampling in pixel space
while explicitly structuring pixel modeling. PixelDiT de-
couples image semantics from per-pixel learning with a
dual-level architecture design: a patch-level DiT with an
aggressive patch size that performs long-range attention
on short patch token sequences to capture global layout
and content, and a pixel-level DiT that performs dense,
per-pixel token modeling to refine local texture details.
We propose two key techniques to make this design effec-
tive: (i) a pixel-wise AdaLN modulation that conditions
each pixel token using semantic tokens, aligning per-pixel
updates with global context; and (ii) a pixel token com-
paction mechanism that compresses each pixel token be-
fore full attention and decompresses them back afterward,
enabling per-pixel token modeling while keeping global
attention efficient. The dual-level pathways, together with
efficient pixel modeling via pixel-wise AdaLN and token
compaction, yield high training efficiency and faster con-
vergence while preserving fine details.
Extensive experiments show that PixelDiT generates high-
quality images when trained end-to-end on pixel space
without any autoencoders. On ImageNet 256 × 256, Pix-
elDiT achieves an FID of 1.61, outperforming recent pixel-
space models by a large margin. We further demonstrate
the scalability of our architecture by extending PixelDiT to
text-to-image generation. Using multi-modal DiT blocks
in the patch-level pathway, we directly train PixelDiT at
10242 resolution in pixel space. To our knowledge, this
represents a significant breakthrough, as prior pixel-space
models have struggled to scale effectively to such reso-
lutions. PixelDiT can generate high-fidelity text-aligned
1K resolution images as shown in Figure 1a and achieves
competitive scores on standard benchmarks compared to
state-of-the-art latent diffusion models. Moreover, oper-
ating directly in pixel space enables PixelDiT to bypass
VAE reconstruction artifacts, leading to significantly better
content preservation for image editing tasks, as shown in
Figure 1b.
We highlight our main contributions as follows:
• We
propose
PixelDiT,
a
single-stage,
fully
transformer-based pixel-space diffusion model that is
trained end-to-end without a separate autoencoder.
• We demonstrate that efficient pixel modeling is the
key factor to practical pixel-space diffusion and pro-
pose a dual-level DiT architecture that disentangles
the learning of global semantics from pixel-level tex-
ture details.
• We introduce a pixel-wise AdaLN modulation mech-
anism and a pixel token compaction mechanism that
jointly enable dense per-pixel token modeling.
• PixelDiT achieves high image quality in both class-
conditioned image generation and text-to-image gen-
eration, significantly outperforming existing pixel-
space generative models and approaching the state-
of-the-art latent diffusion models.

tional autoencoder (VAE) that trades off reconstruction
fidelity and compression rate; a rich line of work im-
proves the autoencoder via better architecture or learn-
ing objective, including stronger compression schemes,
tokenizers [22, 23, 24, 25] and analysis of the reconstruc-
tion–generation optimization dilemma [7]. End-to-end ap-
proaches have also been explored: REPA-E jointly tunes
the VAE and diffusion transformer to align the latent rep-
resentation with the generative objective [8]. Recently,
several works [11, 26] replace the variational bottleneck
with representation autoencoders and report competitive
latents without explicit variational modeling.
Why revisit pixel space? Despite their efficiency, LDMs
inherit a reconstruction bottleneck: sample fidelity is
bounded by the autoencoder, and aggressive compres-
sion tends to remove high-frequency details and fine struc-
tures [4, 22]. Pretraining or co-training a large autoencoder
adds additional data and compute overhead compared to
pixel-space training. Moreover, misalignment between
the autoencoder’s reconstruction objective and the down-
stream generative objective introduces distribution shift in
latent space (e.g., texture smoothing or color shifts) that
the diffusion model must compensate for [7, 8]. Finally,
decoding latency at sampling time incurs additional cost
compared to pixel-space models.
2.2. Pixel-Space Diffusion Models
Pixel-space diffusion models preceded latent-space meth-
ods and remain an active area of research. Early work
establishes high image quality via direct denoising in
pixel space [27], while cascaded diffusion improves high-
resolution synthesis through multi-scale pipelines [20].
However, the quadratic compute and memory cost in im-
age resolution renders end-to-end training at megapixel
scales prohibitively expensive.
Recent efforts revisit
pixel space with improved architectures and training: Jet-
Former formulates autoregressive generation over raw pix-
els and text [13]; Simple Diffusion proposes simplified,
memory-efficient convolutional networks with skip con-
nections [18, 19]; Fractal Generative Models introduce
fractal designs for long-range structure [21]; PixelFlow
develops hierarchical flow-based pixel-space models [17];
and PixNerd employs lightweight neural field layers for
efficient pixel-space diffusion [12]. In contrast to these
efforts, we present a purely transformer-based pixel-space
diffusion architecture trained directly at 10242 resolution.
Concurrent to our work, EPG [15] adopts a two-stage
framework bridging self-supervised pre-training and gen-
erative fine-tuning, while FARMER [14] integrates nor-
malizing flows with autoregressive modeling to handle
high-dimensional pixels. Distinctively, JiT [16] demon-
strates that plain Transformers can efficiently model
high-dimensional data by predicting clean images (𝑥0-
prediction).
3. Method
In this section, we present PixelDiT, a transformer-based
diffusion model that directly performs denoising in pixel
space. Our objective is to make pixel token modeling com-
putationally efficient while preserving the convergence
behavior and sample quality that have motivated latent
space approaches.
3.1. Dual-level DiT Architecture
As illustrated in Figure 2, we adopt a dual-level trans-
former organization that concentrates semantic learning
on a coarse patch-level pathway and leverages dedicated
Pixel Transformer (PiT) blocks in the pixel-level path-
way for detail refinement. This organization allows most
semantic reasoning to occur on the low-resolution grid,
which reduces the burden on the pixel-level pathway and
accelerates learning, consistent with observations found
in [11, 28, 29].
Patch-level architecture:
Let the input image be 𝑥∈

kens 𝑥patch ∈R𝐵×𝐿×(𝑝2𝐶), where 𝐿=( 𝐻
𝑝)( 𝑊
𝑝) is the
number of tokens, and project them to hidden size 𝐷:
𝑠0 = 𝑊patch 𝑥patch,
(1)
𝑐= SiLU(𝑊𝑡𝑡+ 𝑊𝑦𝑦+ 𝑏) ∈R𝐵×1×𝐷.
(2)
Following [7], we augment the DiT block by replacing
LayerNorm with RMSNorm and applying 2D RoPE in all
attention layers. The patch-level pathway consists of 𝑁
augmented DiT blocks; for block 𝑖, we write
˜𝑠𝑖= RMSNorm(𝑠𝑖),

𝑠𝑖= 𝑠𝑖+ 𝛼1(𝑐) ⊙Attn

𝑠𝑖+1 = 𝑠𝑖+ 𝛼2(𝑐) ⊙MLP
(︀
𝛾2(𝑐) ⊙RMSNorm(𝑠𝑖) + 𝛽2(𝑐)
)︀
,
(5)
where AdaLN modulation parameters are produced from
the global conditioning vector 𝑐and then broadcast across
the 𝐿patch tokens. This global-to-patch broadcasting ap-
plies identical per-feature AdaLN parameters to all patch
tokens (i.e., token-independent at the patch level), in con-
trast to the pixel-wise AdaLN used later in the pixel-level
pathway.
After 𝑁blocks, we obtain semantic tokens 𝑠𝑁
∈
R𝐵×𝐿×𝐷. In the spirit of designs [11, 28], we define
the conditioning signal for the pixel-level pathway as
𝑠cond := 𝑠𝑁+𝑡, where 𝑡is the timestep embedding. These
tokens provide semantic context to the PiT blocks via
pixel-wise AdaLN.
Pixel-level architecture:
The pixel-level DiT is com-
posed of 𝑀layers of PiT Blocks. It takes the pixel tokens
and the output of the patch-level DiT 𝑠cond as inputs to
perform the pixel token modeling and generate the final
result. The details of each PiT block are described below.
Design notes.
The patch-level pathway exclusively pro-
cesses patch tokens to capture global semantics. By del-
egating detail refinement to the pixel-level pathway, we
can employ larger patch sizes 𝑝, which shortens the se-
quence length and accelerates inference while preserving
per-pixel fidelity. Furthermore, the pixel-level pathway
operates with a reduced hidden dimension 𝐷pix ≪𝐷(e.g.,
𝐷pix=16), ensuring that dense per-pixel computations re-
main highly efficient.
3.2. Pixel Transformer Block
Each PiT block has two core components. First, pixel-
wise AdaLN enables dense conditioning at the level of
individual pixels, aligning per-pixel updates with global
context. Second, a pixel token compaction mechanism
reduces redundancy among pixel tokens so that global
attention operates on a manageable sequence length.

AdaLN broadcasts a global conditioning vector to all pix-
els. (B) Patch-wise AdaLN expands semantic tokens to
the 𝑝2 pixels within each patch. (C) Pixel-wise AdaLN
applies an MLP to each semantic token to produce per-
pixel scale, shift, and gating parameters, enabling fully
context-aligned updates at every pixel.
Pixel-wise AdaLN Modulation.
In the pixel-level path-
way, each image is embedded into one token per pixel with
a linear layer:
𝑋∈R𝐵×𝐶×𝐻×𝑊
reshape + linear
−−−−−−−−→R𝐵×𝐻×𝑊×𝐷pix.
(6)
To align with patch-level semantic tokens, we reshape
into 𝐵· 𝐿sequences of 𝑝2 pixel tokens, i.e., 𝑋
∈
R(𝐵·𝐿)×𝑝2×𝐷pix.
For each patch, we form a semantic
conditioning token 𝑠cond ∈R(𝐵·𝐿)×𝐷that summarizes
global context. A straightforward patch-wise modulation
would repeat the same parameters for all 𝑝2 pixels within
a patch, as illustrated in Figure 3(B). However, this can-
not capture dense per-pixel variation. Instead, we assign
independent modulation to each pixel by expanding 𝑠cond
into 𝑝2 sets of AdaLN parameters via a linear projection
Φ : R𝐷→R𝑝2·6𝐷pix:
Θ = Φ(𝑠cond) ∈R(𝐵·𝐿)×𝑝2×6𝐷pix,
(7)
and we partition the last dimension of Θ into six
groups of size 𝐷pix, yielding (𝛽1, 𝛾1, 𝛼1, 𝛽2, 𝛾2, 𝛼2) ∈
(︀
R(𝐵·𝐿)×𝑝2×𝐷pix)︀6.
These modulation parameters are
learned and are distinct at every pixel, as illustrated in
Figure 3(C). They are applied to 𝑋via pixel-wise AdaLN,
enabling pixel-specific updates; in contrast, patch-wise
AdaLN broadcasts a single set of parameters to all pix-
els within a patch and thus cannot capture such spatial
variation.

tionally prohibitive. We therefore compress the 𝑝2 pixel
tokens inside each patch into a compact patch token before
global attention, and later expand the attended representa-
tion back to pixels. This reduces the attention sequence
length from 𝐻× 𝑊to 𝐿=( 𝐻
𝑝)( 𝑊
𝑝), a 𝑝2-fold reduction;
with 𝑝=16, this yields a 256× shrinkage while preserv-
ing per-pixel updates through pixel-wise AdaLN and the
learned expansion.
We instantiate the compaction operators with a learned flat-
tening: a linear map 𝒞: R𝑝2×𝐷pix →R𝐷that jointly mixes
spatial and channel dimensions, paired with an expan-
sion ℰ: R𝐷→R𝑝2×𝐷pix. This compress–attend–expand
pipeline keeps global attention efficient. Unlike the lossy
bottleneck in VAEs, this mechanism only compresses the
representation momentarily for the attention operation.
Crucially, this compaction operates purely to reduce the
computational overhead of self-attention; it does not com-
promise fine-grained details, because high-frequency in-
formation is preserved through residual connections and
learned expansion layers that effectively bypass the pixel-
token bottleneck.
3.3. PixelDiT for Text-to-Image Generation
We extend the patch-level pathway with multi-modal DiT
(MM-DiT) blocks [3] that fuse text and image semantics
while leaving the pixel-level pathway unchanged. In each
MM-DiT block, image and text tokens form two streams
with separate QKV projections.
Text embeddings 𝑦∈R𝐵×𝐿txt×𝐷txt are produced by
a frozen Gemma-2 encoder [35]. Following [36], we
prepend a concise system prompt to the user prompt before
feeding the sequence to the text encoder. The resulting
token embeddings are projected to the model width and
used as the text stream in MM-DiT.
Empirically, we find the semantic tokens from the patch-
level pathway are sufficient to convey textual intent to
the pixel updates. The pixel-level pathway is therefore
architecturally identical to the class-conditioned model: it
operates on pixel tokens and is conditioned only through
the semantic tokens together with the timestep. No text
tokens are routed directly to the pixel stream.
3.4. Training Objectives
We adopt the Rectified Flow formulation [37] in pixel
space and train the model with its velocity-matching loss:
ℒdiff = E𝑡,𝑥,𝜀

.
(8)
Following [31], we include an alignment objective that
encourages mid-level patch-pathway tokens to agree with
features from a frozen DINOv2 encoder [38]. The overall

objective is ℒ= ℒdiff + 𝜆repa ℒrepa. We use the same
formulation for class- and text-conditional models.
4. Experiments
We evaluate the effectiveness of PixelDiT through exten-
sive experiments. To demonstrate the scalability of our
approach, we instantiate PixelDiT with three model sizes:
Base (B), Large (L), and Extra Large (XL) for experiments
on ImageNet. The detailed configurations are summarized
in Table 2. Unless otherwise specified, we use PixelDiT-
XL as the default model for all experiments on ImageNet.

4.1. Implementation Details
Class-conditioned Image Generation. We follow the
training setup of [5] and train our model on ImageNet-
1K [39] at 256×256 resolution (denote as ImageNet
256×256) for class-conditioned generation tasks. For the
representation alignment objective, we set 𝜆repa=0.5 and
apply alignment at the eighth block of the patch-level path-
way. Throughout diffusion training, we use logit-normal
sampling [3], EMA with decay 0.9999, AdamW with be-
tas (0.9, 0.999), a batch size of 256, and bfloat16 mixed
precision. We train the model with a constant learning rate
of 1 × 10−4 for the first 160 epochs, then step down to
1 × 10−5 for the remainder. We apply gradient clipping at
1.0 initially and 0.5 thereafter for stability.
Text-to-Image Generation. We use Gemma-2 [35] as the
text encoder and incorporate the MM-DiT conditioning
design [3] on the patch-level pathway. Our PixelDiT-T2I
uses hidden size 1536, patch-level pathway depth 𝑁=14,
and pixel-level pathway depth 𝑀=2. We collect approx-
imately 26M image–text pairs at 10242 resolution with
various aspect ratios to train our model. We first pre-train
the model from scratch at 512 × 512 resolution for 400K
iterations with AdamW (learning rate 1 × 10−4; betas
(0.9, 0.999)), batch size 1,024, gradient clipping 0.5, and
the shifting strategy [3] with shift value 𝛼=3.0. We then
finetune the model at 10242 resolution for another 100K
iterations with AdamW (learning rate 2 × 10−5), batch
size 768, a higher shift value 𝛼=4.0, and gradient clipping
0.1.
Evaluation Settings on ImageNet. Following ADM [27],
we report FID (gFID), sFID, Inception Score, and Preci-
sion–Recall on 50K samples. On ImageNet 256×256, we
use a guidance scale 3.25 with an interval [40] [0.1, 1.0]
for the 80-epoch checkpoint. All other evaluations use a
guidance 2.75 with an interval [0.1, 0.9], unless otherwise
stated.
Evaluation Settings for Text-to-Image. We evaluate
PixelDiT-T2I at 512 × 512 and 10242 resolutions on
GenEval [41] and DPG-Bench [42] using 533 and 1,065
prompts, respectively. Unless noted, we use a fixed guid-
ance scale 4.5 and the shift value aligns with the training
setting at corresponding resolutions.
Sampling at Inference. For both class-conditioned and
text-conditional image generation tasks, we use FlowDPM-
Solver [36], a modified DPMSolver++ [43] in the Rectified
Flow formulation, with bfloat16 precision. By default, we
perform sampling with 100 steps on ImageNet and 25
steps for text-to-image generation.

4.2. Class-conditioned Image Generation on ImageNet
As shown in Table 1, at 320 epochs, our PixelDiT-XL
obtains a gFID of 1.61, surpassing recent pixel-space
models including PixelFlow-XL (gFID 1.98), PixNerd-
XL (gFID 1.93), and EPG (gFID 2.04) by a large margin,
showing a very significant improvement in image quality.
Besides fidelity, PixelDiT-XL exhibits a stronger diver-
sity–faithfulness trade-off, achieving a recall of 0.64 (vs.
0.60 for PixelFlow-XL), with competitive precision (0.78).
Notably, PixelDiT-XL converges quickly: after only 80
epochs it already reaches gFID 2.36 and IS 282.3, out-
performing classical pixel diffusion (ADM-U, gFID 4.59
at 400 epochs) and autoregressive baselines (JetFormer,
gFID 6.64), indicating that structuring pixel modeling ac-
celerates convergence. Note that SiD2 [19] reports a gFID
of 1.38 at 256 × 256, but its model size, training epochs,
IS, and Precision/Recall are unknown. For fairness, we
include its gFID for reference but exclude it from Table 1.
While latent-space models such as REPA and RAE achieve
lower gFID, PixelDiT-XL narrows the gap without any
pretrained autoencoder, demonstrating the potential of
pixel-space diffusion models in generating high-quality
images. This is further supported by qualitative results
in Figure 4. PixelDiT-XL produces sharp textures, coher-
ent object boundaries, and reasonable global structures,
showing superiority of our dual-level architecture design.
4.3. Text-to-Image Generation
Table 3 presents the quantitative results of PixelDiT-T2I
on text-to-image generation task. At 512 × 512 resolution,
PixelDiT-T2I attains a GenEval score of 0.78 and DPG
of 83.7, outperforming recent pixel-space models such as
PixNerd and PixelFlow. At 10242 resolution, PixelDiT-
T2I achieves a GenEval score of 0.74 and DPG of 83.5,
surpassing many latent diffusion models on GenEval and
remaining competitive on DPG. These results indicate that
end-to-end pixel-space diffusion with dual-level design
scales to text-to-image generation with strong text ground-
ing and robust compositionality. Qualitatively, Figure 1(a)
shows representative samples produced by PixelDiT-T2I,
illustrating high-resolution synthesis at the megapixel
scale and consistent multi-resolution generation. More
visualizations are provided in the appendix.
Efficiency. Throughput in Table 3 is measured with fp16
precision on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. PixelDiT-T2I
reaches 1.07 samples per second at 512 × 512 resolution,
exceeding pixel-space baselines PixelFlow and PixNerd.
At 10242 resolution, our PixelDiT-T2I reaches 0.33 sam-
ples per second, comparable to latent diffusion models,
despite denoising directly in pixel space.
4.4. Detail Preservation in Image Editing
In Figure 1(b),
we perform image editing with
FlowEdit [1] and compare the results using latent diffu-
sion models (Stable Diffusion 3, FLUX) and PixelDiT.
While both latent models generate motorcycle to replace
the bicycle, the small scene text on the wall is heavily
distorted. To investigate the cause of the distortion, Fig-

the design schematic in Figure 3.
ure 1(b) presents the direct reconstruction results by the
latent models’ VAEs, which show that the scene text has
already been distorted by the VAE encoder due to its lossy
compression nature, and the error further accumulates in
the latent diffusion process. In contrast, since PixelDiT is
end-to-end trained in pixel space without relying on VAEs,
it does not suffer from the lossy compression distortion.
Therefore, it not only makes correct modifications, but also
preserves the small scene text well, showing significant
advantages on preserving fine details for image editing.
4.5. Ablation Study
4.5.1. Contribution of Core Components
Table 4 quantifies the contribution of the proposed pixel-
modeling components by comparing different model vari-
ants. Note that labels A–C in Table 4 correspond to the
schematic variants in Figure 3. Specifically, we use a
30-layer, 16 × 16 patchified DiT that directly performs
denoising in pixel space as the baseline model (“Vanilla
DiT/16”). This baseline operates solely on patch tokens
without a dedicated pixel-level pathway, treating each
16 × 16 patch as a high-dimensional vector. It obtains
9.84 gFID at 80 epochs. Introducing a dual-level archi-
tecture without pixel token compaction causes global at-
tention to scale quadratically with the number of pixels
and leads to an out-of-memory condition (OOM). Adding
pixel token compaction resolves this bottleneck by short-
ening the global-attention sequence from 𝐻×𝑊pixels
to 𝐿=( 𝐻
𝑝)( 𝑊
𝑝) patches, yielding a significant quality im-
provement to 3.50 gFID at the same 80-epoch budget.
Incorporating pixel-wise AdaLN further aligns per-pixel
updates with the semantic context produced by the patch-
level pathway, improving gFID to 2.36 at 80 epochs and
to 1.61 at 320 epochs.
The comparison between model variants A, B, and C
demonstrates the importance of each proposed compo-
nent. More importantly, the comparison between our full
PixelDiT model C and the vanilla DiT/16 A reveals that
pixel-level token modeling plays a key role in pixel gen-

erative models. Without pixel modeling, i.e., the visual
content is only learned at the patch level, it will be chal-
lenging for the model to learn the fine details, and the
visual quality will degrade significantly.
4.5.2. Analysis on Pixel Token Compaction
Token compaction is essential for making pixel-space train-
ing feasible. A global attention over 𝑁=𝐻× 𝑊pixel
tokens incurs 𝑂(𝑁2) memory and 𝑂(𝑁2𝐷) FLOPs, pro-
ducing billions of attention entries even at 256 × 256 res-
olution, as reflected by the 82,247 GFLOPs reported for
this variant in Table 5. Grouping pixels into 𝑝× 𝑝patches
using pixel token compaction reduces the sequence length
to 𝐿=𝑁/𝑝2, yielding a 𝑝4-fold reduction in attention cost.
To analyze the role of attention in the pixel-level pathway,
we include a “No Pixel-Pathway Attention” ablation that
removes the attention and only keeps pixel-wise AdaLN
and an MLP at the pixel level. As shown in Table 5, while
this variant reduces GFLOPs, it is consistently inferior to
our full PixelDiT model across different training iterations
(e.g., from 80 to 160 epochs), with visible degradation in
gFID and IS. This indicates that compact global attention
is necessary to align local updates with global context.
4.5.3. Impact of Model Size and Patch Size
We investigate the impact of the patch size 𝑝on the perfor-
mance of models at different scales: PixelDiT-B, PixelDiT-
L, and PixelDiT-XL. For all evaluations, we use the same
CFG guidance scale 3.25 with interval [0.10, 1.00]. We
evaluate patch sizes of 4, 8, 16, and 32 on ImageNet
256×256; Figure 5(a) visualizes the resulting convergence
behavior. For the base model, moving from 𝑝=32 to 𝑝=16
and 𝑝=4 substantially accelerates convergence: at 200K
iterations gFID drops from 48.5 (B/32) to 15.1 (B/16)
and 6.7 (B/4), and B/4 ultimately reaches 3.4 gFID at
500K iterations. Larger models follow a similar trend, but
the benefit of very small patches diminishes with scale.
For PixelDiT-L, using 𝑝=8 rather than 𝑝=16 improves
gFID only modestly (from 2.72 to 2.15 at 300K itera-
tions), and for PixelDiT-XL the gap between 𝑝=8 and
8

PixelDiT: Pixel Diffusion Transformers for Image Generation
𝑝=16 essentially vanishes—both configurations converge
to gFID near 2.0. These results highlight a clear trade-off:
smaller patches yield better image quality or faster conver-
gence but incur a quadratic cost in sequence length, and
the relative gain shrinks as the model capacity increases.
In practice, we therefore use 𝑝=16 as the default patch
size for PixelDiT-XL, which offers near-optimal quality
at substantially lower compute.
To analyze the standalone effect of model size, Figure 5(b)
directly compares B, L, and XL variants at a fixed patch
size 𝑝=16. Scaling the model yields consistent gains
across the entire training trajectory: at 200K iterations,
gFID improves from 15.1 (B/16) to 4.95 (L/16) and 2.95
(XL/16), and at 1M iterations XL/16 reaches 1.94 gFID
compared to roughly 2.1 for L/16. Thus, increasing capac-
ity improves both image quality and the speed at which a
given quality level is reached, demonstrating the scalability
of PixelDiT.
We leave more ablation studies to the Appendix.
5. Conclusion
In this work, we revisited diffusion modeling in pixel
space and showed that, with appropriate architectural de-
sign, pixel-space Diffusion Transformers can achieve high
fidelity and efficiency without relying on a pretrained au-
toencoder. PixelDiT factors pixel modeling into a dual-
level transformer design and introduces pixel-wise AdaLN
and pixel token compaction to decouple global seman-
tics from per-pixel token learning while keeping attention
affordable. Experiments on class-conditioned image gener-
ation and text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that
this design closes much of the gap between latent-space
and pixel-space methods and yields strong performance at
high resolutions.
While pixel-space diffusion incurs higher computational
costs than latent approaches due to the raw data dimen-
sionality, our work narrows this efficiency gap. Overall,
PixelDiT highlights that the main barrier to practical pixel-
space diffusion is not the representation space, but the
absence of efficient pixel modeling architectures. We hope
this perspective will inspire more fundamental research on
pixel-space generative modeling.

PixelDiT: Pixel Diffusion Transformers for Image Generation
A. Architecture and System Details
A.1. Summary of Model Size
To study the impact of model size, we evaluate the base
(B), large (L), and extra-large (XL) variants of PixelDiT
on ImageNet 256×256. Tables 6 and 7 summarize the
detailed architectural specifications and training settings
for B, L, XL and T2I variants. Note that the default
configuration of all experiments in the main paper is
PixelDiT-XL. If not otherwise specified, we use the XL
configuration for all ImageNet 256×256 experiments in
this appendix.
A.2. Text-to-Image Architecture with MM-DiT
Figure 6 illustrates the T2I variant of PixelDiT, where the
patch-level pathway is extended with MM-DiT blocks [3]
to fuse text embeddings, while the pixel-level pathway
remains unchanged. The figure emphasizes stream sepa-
ration, conditioning flow, and the pixel-wise modulation
interface used by the pixel-level pathway.
B. Solvers and Guidance Scales
B.1. Ablation of Solvers
We compare three diffusion samplers for denoising on Im-
ageNet 256×256: FlowDPMSolver [36, 43], Euler, and
Heun, all run for 100 steps without classifier-free guidance.
Figure 7 plots gFID, sFID, Inception Score (IS), precision,
and recall as training progresses from 100K to 1,200K iter-
ations. Across most of the training trajectory, FlowDPM-
Solver achieves lower or comparable gFID and sFID than
Euler and Heun, with the gap particularly pronounced in
the low- and mid-epoch regimes (up to roughly 1–2 gFID
points around 400K–800K iterations). FlowDPMSolver
maintains the best overall trade-off: it matches or exceeds
the competing solvers on sFID and IS while keeping pre-
cision and recall high. These results motivate our choice
of FlowDPMSolver as the default sampler for all main
ImageNet and text-to-image evaluations.
B.2. Inference Steps
We further analyze the impact of the number of inference
steps when using FlowDPMSolver. Figure 8 shows gFID
for PixelDiT-XL at three training stages (100K, 400K, and
1.6M iterations) as we vary the sampling budget from 25
to 100 steps. At 100K iterations the model is undertrained
and additional steps give only modest improvements, with
gFID remaining in the 6–7 range. Once the model has
learned reasonable global structure (400K iterations), in-
creasing the budget from 25 to 50 steps reduces gFID from
about 3.19 to 2.51, and 100 steps further improves it to
2.36. For the fully converged checkpoint at 1.6M itera-

Figure 7 | Comparison of FlowDPMSolver, Euler, and Heun samplers on ImageNet 256×256 with 100 inference steps
and no classifier-free guidance. FlowDPMSolver achieves the best combined trade-off between fidelity in gFID and
sFID and diversity in IS, precision, and recall, which motivates its use as our default sampler.
tions, 25 steps already achieve gFID ≈2.50, but 50–75
steps lower it to around 1.76–1.74, and 100 steps obtain
the best score of approximately 1.61 gFID. Overall, more
inference steps consistently benefit well-trained models,
though the marginal gain beyond 50 steps becomes small.
In practice we therefore use 100 steps for class-conditioned
ImageNet experiments to match the strongest quality, and
25 steps for text-to-image generation where sampling la-
tency is more critical.
B.3. Guidance Scale and Interval
We report the classifier-free guidance (CFG) settings used
for PixelDiT-XL at 80 and 320 epochs on ImageNet
256×256. Table 8 lists the CFG scale, active time in-
terval, and the resulting gFID, sFID, IS, precision, and
recall. For the 80-epoch checkpoint, the best gFID is 2.36,
obtained with a relatively strong guidance scale of 3.25
applied over the entire denoising trajectory from 𝑡=0.10
to 𝑡=1.00. Increasing the scale to 3.50 or decreasing it to
3.00 slightly worsens gFID while mainly trading off IS
and recall, and restricting the active interval to [0.10, 0.95]
or [0.10, 0.90] does not lead to better performance. For the
320-epoch checkpoint, the optimum shifts toward milder
guidance: a scale of 2.75 active on the interval [0.10, 0.90]
achieves the best gFID of 1.61 together with strong re-
call of 0.64, whereas both larger and smaller scales yield
at most marginal IS gains at the cost of higher gFID.
In the main paper we therefore adopt a guidance scale
of 3.25 with interval [0.10, 1.00] for the 80-epoch Ima-
geNet 256×256 results, and a scale of 2.75 with interval
[0.10, 0.90] for the 320-epoch checkpoint that underpins
our best reported scores.
C. Model Architecture Design
C.1. Ablation on Depth N and M
We analyze how to allocate depth between the patch-level
pathway (𝑁layers) and the pixel-level pathway (𝑀layers)
under a fixed total budget of roughly 𝑁+𝑀≈30 layers.
Figure 9 shows convergence curves for several (𝑁, 𝑀)
configurations evaluated on ImageNet 256×256. All eval-
uations use the same CFG guidance scale 3.25 with inter-
val [0.10, 1.00]. Introducing even a shallow pixel pathway
(e.g., 𝑁=28, 𝑀=2) dramatically improves convergence
and reduces final gFID to around 2.1. Our default configu-
ration (𝑁=26, 𝑀=4) provides the best overall behavior:

it reaches gFID 2.34 by 300K iterations and continues to
improve to 1.94 at 1M iterations, outperforming both the
shallower pixel pathway (𝑁=28, 𝑀=2) and the deeper
one (𝑁=22, 𝑀=8). The latter attains similar final gFID
but converges more slowly in early epochs. These trends
indicate that dedicating a moderate but not excessive num-
ber of layers to the pixel-level pathway is crucial for effi-
cient pixel modeling and underpins the strong ImageNet
results reported in the main paper.
C.2. Study on Pixel Token Compaction (PTC) Rate
We investigate the effectiveness of Pixel Token Com-
paction (PTC) by varying the compaction rate. Recall
that our default patch size is 𝑝. Without compaction, the
pixel-level pathway would process a sequence of length
𝐻× 𝑊. With standard compaction (denoted as “Seq Len
𝐿(1×)” or Base), the 𝑝× 𝑝pixels in a patch are com-
pressed into a single token, reducing the sequence length
to 𝐿= (𝐻/𝑝) × (𝑊/𝑝). We explore relaxing this com-
pression by allowing the compacted sequence length to be
multiples of the base length 𝐿. Specifically:
• Seq Len 𝐿(1×): The default setting. Compresses 𝑝2
pixels to 1 token. Compression rate: 𝑝2.
• Seq Len 2𝐿(2×): Compresses 𝑝2 pixels to 2 tokens.
Compression rate: 𝑝2/2.
• Seq Len 4𝐿(4×): Compresses 𝑝2 pixels to 4 tokens.
Compression rate: 𝑝2/4.
Figure 10 presents the ablation results. Across training, all
three settings converge to strong gFID values around 2.0,
while the model with the most aggressive compression
(Seq Len 1×) obtains slightly better results. For example,
at 300K iterations the three configurations obtain gFID of
roughly 2.34 (1×), 2.38 (2×), and 2.43 (4×), respectively.
At 1M iterations the 1× variant is further improved to 1.94
while the longer sequences plateau slightly higher. The
result suggests that, for the pixel-level pathway, a compact
representation is sufficient to capture the residual infor-
mation needed for texture refinement. This could be due
to the redundant nature of the pixel-space tokens. Inter-

Figure 8 | Effect of the number of FlowDPMSolver infer-

fully trained (400K and 1.6M iterations), with diminishing
returns beyond 50 steps; we adopt 100 steps as the default
for ImageNet experiments.
estingly, the results indicate that lower compression rates
do not necessarily lead to better image quality. We sus-
pect that a longer, redundant token sequence and a larger
attention space can be more challenging to optimize and
slower to converge under the same training setting. Using
more tokens in the pixel-level pathway may require care-
fully adjusted training settings to unlock its full potential.
Since the attention cost grows almost quadratically with
the compressed token length, the model with 1× com-
paction performs similarly to other configurations, thus
we adopt it as the default setting throughout the paper for
efficiency.

D. Benchmark Details
D.1. DPG-Bench and GenEval Category Breakdown
Tables 9 and 10 report category-wise results for GenEval
and DPG-Bench at 5122 and 10242 resolutions.
On
GenEval at 5122, PixelDiT-T2I outperforms prior pixel-
space models. At 10242 resolution, PixelDiT-T2I matches
or surpasses several widely used latent diffusion systems
despite using fewer parameters, and maintains competitive
performance across all individual categories. On DPG-
Bench, PixelDiT-T2I ranks among the top-performing
models while maintaining balanced scores across cate-
gories. These detailed breakdowns corroborate that Pix-
elDiT delivers strong text–image alignment and compo-
sitional reasoning, closing much of the gap to heavily
engineered latent diffusion models.

Figure 10 | Ablation of Pixel Token Compaction rates
on ImageNet 256×256. The curves compare three post-
compaction sequence lengths, denoted as “Seq Len 𝐿
(1×)”, “Seq Len 2𝐿(2×)”, and “Seq Len 4𝐿(4×)”, where
𝐿is the number of patch tokens after compaction. “Seq
Len 𝐿(1×)” corresponds to our default configuration in
which each 𝑝2 pixel block is compacted into a single token.
E. FLOPs Estimation and Comparison
We estimate GFLOPs for a single forward pass at 2562
input resolution. For the GFLOPs of prior work, we reuse
the numbers reported in their papers [16, 19] and convert
them to a unified convention where one multiply-add
counts as two FLOPs. Table 11 compares the compute
cost and FID of PixelDiT-XL with representative latent-
space and pixel-space generative models on ImageNet
256×256. Latent models achieve very strong FIDs with
around 240–290 GFLOPs, whereas many pixel models
require several hundred to several thousand GFLOPs to
close this quality gap. In contrast, PixelDiT-XL obtains
a 1.61 FID with only 311 GFLOPs, offering superior im-
age quality over the state-of-the-art pixel generators and
closing much of the gap between the best latent models,
while using a compute that is close to latent models and
substantially less than most prior pixel-space models.
F. Qualitative Examples
We include additional qualitative results for ImageNet
256×256 single-class-conditioned image generations, as
shown in Figures 15–22, together with high-resolution
(approximately 10242) text-to-image generation results in
Figures 11–14, illustrating the visual quality, diversity, and
prompt alignment achieved by PixelDiT.
G. Limitations
Due to the limited model capacity and insufficient high-
quality training data, our PixelDiT-T2I text-to-image
model (1.3B parameters) sometimes struggles to generate
objects that are both geometrically and texturally complex,

light. The man in the foreground, dressed in a blue and white striped shirt, gestures casually, holding what appears to be a cigarette. The table is set with wine bottles and glasses, indicating a leisurely
gathering. Through the trellis, a glimpse of the river reveals rowers in action, with a lone figure in a boat further out. The greenery of the trellis and the river landscape blend, contributing to the painting’s
overall sense of depth and atmospheric perspective.
A woman stands on a rooftop at dusk, overlooking a cityscape illuminated by twinkling lights. Her curly hair frames a serious expression, and she leans casually against the rooftop railing. The soft lighting
of the sunset blends with the artificial glow of the city, creating a warm yet muted atmosphere. The out-of-focus background emphasizes the vastness of the urban landscape, dotted with skyscrapers and
distant roads. Her dark jacket adds a layer of contrast, focusing the viewer’s attention on her face. The overall style evokes a sense of urban solitude and reflection against a backdrop of a vibrant cityscape.
A golden-hued lioness rests serenely in a sunlit grassy field. The lioness, bathed in the warm glow of the setting or rising sun, is positioned in the foreground, lying comfortably on a small mound of earth
covered with dry grass. Her paws are outstretched, relaxed and slightly crossed. The background is a soft, blurred mix of green and golden foliage, hinting at a savanna-like landscape. The golden light
emphasizes the texture of her fur and highlights the contours of her face, adding a sense of calm and natural grandeur to the scene.

A young woman with striking eyes gazes directly at the viewer, set against a soft, blurred background. Her long, auburn hair falls loosely around her shoulders, partially
obscuring one side of her face, while a vertically striped, collared shirt completes her casual yet elegant look. The lighting is warm and natural, emphasizing the subtle
contours of her face and the slight flush in her cheeks. The photograph captures a blend of relaxed confidence and introspective beauty, rendered with a soft focus that lends
a dreamlike quality to the image. The surrounding environment is intentionally muted, ensuring that the woman remains the primary focal point. The color palette leans
towards earthy tones, enhancing the overall warmth and approachability of the portrait.
