ABSTRACT
Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown impressive performance in both understanding
and generation with a single architecture. However, UMMs still exhibit a fundamental inconsis-
tency: understanding favors compact embeddings, whereas generation favors reconstruction-rich
representations. This structural trade-off produces misaligned decision boundaries, degraded cross-
modal coherence, and heightened vulnerability under distributional and adversarial shifts. In this
paper, we present UniGame, a self-adversarial post-training framework that directly targets the in-
consistencies. By applying a lightweight perturber at the shared token interface, UniGame enables
the generation branch to actively seek and challenge fragile understanding, turning the model itself
into its own adversary. Experiments demonstrate that UniGame significantly improves the consis-
tency (+4.6%). Moreover, it also achieves substantial improvements in understanding (+3.6%),
generation (+0.02), out-of-distribution and adversarial robustness (+4.8% and +6.2% on Natu-
ralBench and AdVQA). The framework is architecture-agnostic, introduces < 1% additional pa-
rameters, and is complementary to existing post-training methods. These results position adver-
sarial self-play as a general and effective principle for enhancing the coherence, stability, and
unified competence of future multimodal foundation models.

Introduction
Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capability in both visual understanding
and image generation with a unified architecture [4, 38, 28, 42, 41, 40]. By jointly leveraging a language model
backbone and a visual tokenizer–decoder stack [18, 2], these models promise a unified interface for cross-modal rea-
soning, grounded perception, and controllable generation. Specifically, the large-scale pre-training establishes general
multimodal capabilities, and the post-training stage (supervised fine-tuning, SFT, Figure 2a) can further improve their
performance on downstream tasks with enhanced reliability.
Despite their great performance, UMMs exhibit structural inconsistency between their understanding and generation
pathways [43, 37]. This inconsistency stems from the inherently conflicting nature of the two objectives, leading to the
mismatch in various aspects such as semantics (i.e., the model can answer a question correctly yet fail to generate a
corresponding image, or vice versa [6, 31]), capability (e.g., generation is harder to improve than understanding, or vice
versa [30]), and feature compactness (e.g., understanding requires more compact feature space while generation prefers
oppositely). Inconsistency widely exists in real-world applications, where models frequently encounter unexpected
inputs far from the training manifold, compositional combinations unseen during training, counterfactual queries, or
modality conflicts such as distribution shift [6, 14, 24, 25] and adversarial attack [16]. If not sufficiently studied, it
would greatly undermine multimodal information fusion, model robustness, and further performance improvement.
It remains challenging and unexplored to improve the consistency of UMMs, primarily due to the unclear learning
objectives: only the consequences, but not the causes, are known. Therefore, recent post-training approaches tend to
fill this gap using surrogate objectives. Reconstruction-based approaches (Figure 2b) regenerate the original images
through the semantic embedding space derived from visual perception [37, 43]. They optimize a unified reconstruction

objective, which trains models within a closed auto-encoding loop. Reward-based methods (Figure 2c) typically
optimize an ensembled reward function [13], combining task-specific or rule-based metrics to refine the output relying
on external expert models. However, both are optimized using handcrafted objectives (reconstruction or reward),
which only polish model behavior on a fixed training distribution and place no explicit constraints on the two coupling
branches. As a result, they reproduce behaviors within a fixed manifold rather than expanding the shared generative
space, leaving the inconsistency largely unresolved.
Can a UMM expose and correct its own inconsistencies from within? In this paper, motivated by the observation that
adversarial signals reliably surface brittle reasoning in vision–language models [6, 14, 24, 31], we propose UniGame
(Figure 3), the first self-adversarial post-training framework for UMMs. UniGame treats the generation pathway as
an active adversary that searches for visually plausible, decoder-constrained perturbations that maximally challenge
the understanding branch. It pushes the model beyond fixed data manifolds and produces structured adversarial sam-
ples along the uncertainty regions (Figure 1a). Concretely, UniGame installs a lightweight perturber at the shared
visual-token interface to create bounded, structured perturbations. These perturbations are decoded into realistic ad-
versarial images, filtered through a semantic consistency check, and stored in a hard-example buffer. The understand-
ing branch is then optimized to correctly reason over both clean inputs and these internally generated, semantically
aligned counterexamples. This forms a minimax self-play process where generation seeks to expose weaknesses while
understanding learns from them, effectively expanding the shared generative manifold toward fragile yet meaningful
regions (Figure 1b; theoretical insights in Appendix G.3). Compared to existing efforts, UniGame explicitly converts
representational weaknesses into decoded, semantically coherent counterexamples that efficiently harden understand-
ing (Figure 2). Empirically, UniGame uncovers richer, actionable failure modes (e.g., counting, fine attributes, and
occlusion in Figure 5a) and improves the consistency, performance, and robustness.
This paper makes the following contributions:
1. Novel framework. We propose UniGame as the first framework to formalize UMMs post-training as a
self-play game to improve the consistency between the understanding and generative pathways.
2. Self-play training algorithm. We instantiate UniGame by devising a flexible co-training algorithm that
combines the perturber, regularizer, and hardness-aware mining modules. The algorithm is agnostic to both
UMM architectures and post-training approaches.

Related Work
Unified Multimodal Models. UMMs aim to combine multimodal understanding and generation within a single
backbone, enabling compact deployment and richer cross-modal reasoning [1, 38, 36, 3, 28, 4, 28]. Among these,
BLIP3-o [1] explores hybrid autoregressive and diffusion training recipes to balance understanding and generation
fidelity. Emu3 [38] treats images and text as an interleaved token stream and scales next-token prediction to unified
multimodal outputs. TokenFlow [28] focuses on the tokenizer layer and introduces dual-granularity codebooks to
reconcile the conflicting demands of discriminative understanding vs reconstructive generation. Despite architectural
innovation, UMMs continue to face the inconsistency issue: the representation granularity and objective tension that
underlie understanding and generation still cause ambiguous shared embeddings and latent failure modes that remain
insufficiently addressed.
Post-training of UMMs. Aiming to resolve the inconsistency issue, existing post-training methods can be catego-
rized into these types: (i) reconstruction and semantic-alignment losses to encourage fidelity [37, 43]; (ii) RL/reward-
based optimization to directly optimize downstream metrics [32, 13]. Each family improves either fidelity or robust-
ness [15, 2, 37, 6, 31, 32, 28], For instance, RecA [37] leverages reconstruction alignment by conditioning generation
on understanding embeddings and using reconstruction losses to bring representations closer, while T2I-R1 [13] en-
hances image generation through collaborative semantic- and token-level chain-of-thought combined with reinforce-
ment learning. In the vision–language domain, AT has shown potential: VILLA introduces large-scale embedding-
space perturbations across image and text modalities, improving robustness and generalization [6, 31]. Nevertheless,
most methods either improve alignment or generation separately, and adversarial mechanisms are rarely incorporated
into full UMMs. They commonly fail in one crucial respect: they do not exploit generation as an active adversarial
process to strengthen the understanding branch. Specifically, adversarial or unguided embedding perturbations often
produce off-manifold samples—unrealistic or semantically invalid artifacts, while reconstruction objectives do not
intentionally surface decision-critical failure modes. Although RL-based schemes are effective, they are computation-
ally costly and do not guarantee that these discovered examples remain decodable and semantically plausible [32, 13].
This leaves a key gap in truly improving the consistency of the understanding and generation pathways.

Preliminary
Let x denote an image, q a vision-grounded query, and a the ground-truth answer. After a frozen visual encoder and
a projection layer, we write the unified visual tokenizer, which quantizes image representations into tokens aligned
with the language model’s vocabulary embedding space as z = Enc(x) ∈RN×H, where N is the token length and
H the hidden dimension.2 Both visual and textual embeddings are then fed into a language model to learn high-level
embeddings. The understanding branch U aims to minimize the discriminative loss of the textual output, and the
generation branch G tends to reconstruct the input image:
Lund(θU) := −E

Lgen(θG) := E

enizer. We omit these details for simplicity.

Motivation
UMMs inherently exhibit inconsistencies between the understanding and generation pathways due to their conflict-
ing optimization requirements: the understanding branch favors task-oriented embeddings, but generation demands
reconstruction-rich representations. Both branches operate on a shared generative manifold induced by encoding
interface and decoder; any mismatch in how they carve up this manifold directly translates into structural inconsis-
tencies. Improving consistency is challenging primarily owing to the lack of clear, direct learning objectives: We can
only observe the consequences (e.g., semantic mismatches, capability gaps) but struggle to identify their underlying
causes.
Existing efforts [37, 13] optimize for individual goals on a fixed set of data distributions, and place no explicit con-
straints on the two coupling training objectives. They encourage cooperative training, reproducing existing samples
rather than expanding coverage of the shared manifold, where boundary behavior is most fragile, thus aggravating in-
consistency. We argue that improving consistency requires expanding this shared manifold, especially around decision
boundaries, instead of merely polishing the model within its comfort regions.
Considering the unified architecture of UMMs: can we improve the consistency within the model itself? We turn
to adversarial training [21], which creates adversarial perturbations to explore understanding failures [6, 31]. This
indicates that adversarial signals, if properly constrained, can serve as an effective mechanism for regularizing the
decision boundaries of UMMs. Within the UMM architecture, we focus on converting generative priors into decod-
able adversarial cases that (i) remain semantically valid and (ii) reliably expose genuine reasoning failures in the
understanding branch. This intuitively motivates the self-play training paradigm that makes best use of both of the
understanding and generation branches as a minimax optimization framework. The generative pathway no longer
passively follows alignment objectives: it is explicitly trained to produce realistic, on-manifold adversarial cases that
challenge the understanding module, while the understanding branch is optimized to solve these internally generated
challenges.
3.3
Overview of UniGame
As shown in Figure 3, the proposed UniGame introduces two lightweight, plug-in modules to a general UMM:
• Perturber C: A compact network with parameters θC (|θC| ≪min(|θU|, |θG|)) that maps the post-LM
fused visual states ˆz to a perturbed token: ˜z = C(ˆz; θC) = ˆz + δ, where ∥δ∥≤εmax is the budget to cap
the perturbation magnitude for stabilization, We control the budget through an ablation study and use the
best-performing setting in all main experiments. Details of the perturber architecture are in Appendix B.3.
3The term “jointly” here denotes simultaneous (multi-task) optimization of both branches—possibly sharing backbone parame-
ters—rather than strictly sequential stage-wise training.

• Hard-sample buffer B: A component that scores decoded candidates and stores hard, semantically plausible
examples for replay via semantic-consistency check [30]:

where H = CE

is the cross-entropy loss and τ is the threshold.
We refer the original generation branch as the clean path, then the perturber introduces a perturbed path. In UniGame,
a frozen visual encoder maps an input image to visual tokens at the unified interface. In the clean path, it is forwarded
to the understanding head for supervised training with the query q; In the perturbed path, the embeddings with pertur-
bations generated by C are decoded by G into candidate images. The semantically consistent candidates are stored in
the buffer B. During training, the understanding module learns from hard examples from B and clean samples, and
the perturber C is optimized to generate challenging yet plausible cases. The vision encoder (SigLIP [46]) is frozen,
and only LoRA [12] adapters on the LLM backbone and the Perturber C are trainable.
The overall training objective is a minimax game:
min
θU max
θC

LU(θU) + λLC(θC; θU)

,
(5)
where λ > 0 controls the strength of the self-play signal between these two branches. We provide some theoretical
insights to the convergence in Appendix G: Under bounded perturbation and decoder constraints, the perturber op-
timizes a lower bound of the worst-case understanding loss. This ensures the minimax dynamics remain stable and
prevents off-manifold adversarial drift. We will elaborate on LU and LC in next section.
3.4
The Self-Play Training Process
The training objective in Eq. (5) consists primarily of two adversarial and iterative steps: to enable the understanding
and generation branches to challenge each other. The complete training procedure is presented in Appendix A and we
introduce only these two challenging steps.
Understanding Challenges Generation (the solid arrows in Figure 3). This is the naive feedforward path that opti-
mizes the understanding module to prevent the generation branch from confusing it, i.e., to “challenge” the generation
branch. The clean path forwards the original visual tokens z directly to the understanding head U, producing the
model’s nominal predictions and the standard supervised loss.
Here, the clean path preserves the original semantic information and simply computes the supervised loss; semantic
plausibility and regularization are enforced on the generation side via the perturber’s norm and CLIP-based filtering
from the hard-example mining buffer. Formally:
LU(θU) = Eclean

CE(pU(ˆa | z, q; θU), a)

+ β EB

CE(pU(ˆa | z, q; θU), a)

,
(6)
where the first term keeps the model accurate on clean data, the second term forces U to correctly answer on current
adversarial examples and mined hard cases, and β > 0 is a trade-off hyperparameter.
Generation Challenges Understanding (the dashed arrow in Figure 3). In this process, the perturbed embedding ˜z
will be rendered by the decoder G into image candidates: ˜x = G(˜z), which are then subject to semantic-consistency
checks (e.g., CLIP [30] similarity) and re-encoding/scoring by the understanding module. This path intentionally
produces on-manifold adversarial examples to challenge the understanding branch, and hard candidates are stored in
the buffer B for replay. Formally, the perturber is updated to maximize the understanding loss:
LC(θC; θU) =
EcleanCE
 pU(ˆa | Enc(G(C(ˆz; θC))), q; θU), a

Discussion
UniGame vs. GANs. UniGame is different from conventional GANs [9] that train a generator to fool a discrimina-
tor [9, 29]. First, GAN needs an extra discriminator for the adversarial game, while ours can operate within a UMM
to leverage its own understanding and generation branches. Second, GANs primarily focus on generation tasks while
ours targets both generation and understanding, involving more complex training and optimization process.
UniGame vs. Adversarial Training (AT). UniGame is the first attempt of applying AT [21, 10] to UMMs, but has
the following differences. First, AT is mainly used for enhancing adversarial robustness, while ours explores AT for

consistency improvement. Second, UniGame differs fundamentally from prior AT by enforcing decoder-constrained,
on-manifold image perturbations, enabling self-generated adversarial cases that remain semantically meaningful.
Extensibility. UniGame is agnostic to most UMM architectures and post-training approaches. First, since it is a
general training framework that only introduces a lightweight trainable perturber, it is flexible to be integrated into most
UMMs. Second, it does not conflict with existing methods, but can serve as their complement for further improvement
on consistency and performance. We further explore the intergration of UniGame with emerging post-training method
e.g., [13, 37], we train their post-trained model and demonstrate further improvements (see §4.6).

Experiments
In this section, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed UniGame.
4.1
Experimental Setup
Tasks and datasets. We evaluated UniGame on popular benchmarks. Specifically, VQAv2 [11], MMMU [45],
POPE [17], and MMBench [20] are adopted for understanding evaluation and GenEval [8] is employed for generation
evaluation. For the evaluation of consistency, we report WISE score [23] and UnifiedBench [43]. For OOD robustness,
we adopt NaturalBench [14], a challenging benchmark comprising real-world images captured in natural, uncontrolled
environments (e.g., low lighting, occlusion, unusual viewpoints) that test robust visual reasoning. For adversarial ro-
bustness, we adopt AdVQA [16], an adversarially constructed VQA dataset where questions are intentionally designed
to mislead models through linguistic ambiguity and visual distractors.
Implementation details. We implemented UniGame on a popular Janus-Pro-7B [3] UMM for main experiments,
and further validated with two toy models that simulate distinct UMMs designs, similar to UAE [43]. The perturber
is implemented as a 3-layer MLP operating on the shared visual-token space RN×H, adding only 2.1M parameters
and outputting token-wise perturbations followed by normalization and clipping. We adopt the open-source VQAv2
training set and CC3M [35]. More training details are in Appendix B.
Baselines. We compare UniGame to two categories of baselines: (1) Different UMMs: (i) Auto-regressive mod-
els [3, 36, 28, 7, 42], which unify understanding and generation through next-token prediction in a shared token
space, with improvements in vision tokenizers; (ii) Diffusion-based models [1, 41], which leverage latent diffusion for
generation while maintaining autoregressive understanding (e.g., BLIP-3o [1], OmniGen2 [41]); (iii) Hybrid architec-
tures [19, 4], which employ specialized modules for different modalities (e.g., UniWorld-V1 [19], BAGEL [4]). (2)
Post-training methods: (i) Reconstruction-based alignment, which uses caption-then-reconstruct cycles to enhance
understanding-generation consistency (e.g., RecA [37]); (ii) Reward-based approaches, which use reward function to
refine their outputs(e.g, [13]) Unlike these methods, UniGame introduces decoder-constrained self-adversarial train-
ing, converting latent inconsistencies into visually coherent counterexamples to improve reasoning robustness while
preserving generation fidelity.
4Consistency Score = 0.6×UnifiedBench+0.4×(WISE×100), jointly assessing self-consistency in understanding generated
content (UnifiedBench) and prompt-image alignment (WISE), results marked with ‡ show improvement over base model.

Consistency Evaluation
We evaluated consistency on two benchmarks:
UnifiedBench [43] and WISE score [23].
UnifiedBench is a
reconstruction-based benchmark tailored for UMMs, where the “caption–generate–compare” protocol measures how
consistently information is preserved when images is converted into text and decoded back into images; the unified
score is defined as the similarity between the ground truth and reconstructed images. WISE is a world-knowledge-
informed text-to-image benchmark with 1000 knowledge-intensive prompts that are scored by a multimodal judge
along consistency with the prompt, realism, and aesthetic quality; its overall Score emphasizes how faithfully the
generated image reflects the textual description, making it a natural testbed for text-to-image consistency.
We followed Protocol 1 from [43] to evaluate the consistency of UniGame. Specifically, we randomly sampled 100
images from LAION-5B [34] as a test set. For each image, the model first generated a caption (understanding), based
on which the model then reconstructed the image (generation). Finally, we computed the similarity scores between
the original and reconstructed images using four vision-language backbones (CLIP [30], SigLIP [46], DINO-v2 [27],
and DreamSim [5]).
As shown in Table 1, UniGame substantially improves the unification score across all metrics compared to both the
Janus-Pro baseline and SFT-only training. This improvement demonstrates that self-play training not only enhances
understanding, but also strengthens the bidirectional consistency between the understanding and generation branches,
forcing the model to maintain semantic coherence across modalities and reducing the understanding-generation gap
inherent in dual unified architectures.

Benchmark Results
UniGame improves both understanding and generation. Table 2 and Table 3 show the results on understanding
and generation benchmarks, respectively. The results demonstrate significant improvements of UniGame over most
competitors in both tasks. Specifically for understanding tasks, UniGame shows an average improvement of 3.1% over
SFT, and 3.6% over the baseline model. UniGame also outperforms other larger models such as TokenFlow-XL, Emu3,
and BLIP-3o, demonstrating that creating adversarial examples can serve as an effective augmentation approach. As
for generation, UniGame outperforms most competitors such as TokenFlow-XL and OminiGen, achieving stronger
performance than the base model and SFT. Note that UniGame performs slightly worse than UAE and RecA (0.82 vs.
0.86), which is mainly due to UAE and RecA’s explicit post-training on generation tasks, while ours was primarily
trained on understanding tasks.
UniGame improves model robustness. We evaluated the OOD and adversarial robustness on NaturalBench [14]
and AdVQA [16], respectively. Following Li et al. [14], we report Group Accuracy (G-Acc), which awards one
point only when a model correctly answers all four (image, question) pairs in a test sample. For AdVQA, we report
standard accuracy as used in prior work. As shown in Figure 4a, UniGame exhibits significant improvement in OOD
and adversarial benchmarks (4.8 % and 6.2 % gain, respectively), suggesting its strong performance in robustness,
confirming UniGame effectively expand the decision boundaries, as in Figure 5a we explicitly probe four fine-grind
visual reasoning cases, where base models fail but UniGame reasoned correctly. For space reasons, we present full
experiments, additional ablations, and detailed OOD/adversarial robustness breakdowns in Appendix C and D.

Ablation Study
Table 4 shows the comparison between the embedding-only and decoder-constrained adversarial perturbations under
matched settings. For embedding-only baselines, we apply perturbations directly in the visual token space without
decoding, using cosine similarity constraints to prevent excessive token drift. The strongest embedding baseline in-
corporating adversarial perturbations, token-space cosine constraints, and buffer replay achieves 80.2% accuracy on
VQAv2, representing a modest +0.7% improvement over the SFT baseline. In contrast, our decoder-constrained
approach forces perturbations to pass through the model’s native decoder, rendering adversarial tokens into realistic
images before evaluation. Notably, even without CLIP filtering, decoding alone improves accuracy to 81.5% (+2.0%
over SFT and +1.3% over embedding perturbation), demonstrating that on-manifold constraints are inherently su-
perior to token-space constraints. When we apply cosine similarity constraints in the decoded image feature space,
performance further increases to 82.2%. Replacing feature-level cosine with CLIP’s text-image semantic matching
yields 82.7%, validating that semantic constraints outperform purely geometric ones.
This ablation reveals three key insights: (i) the embedding-level perturbations can only leverage weak adversarial sig-
nals (+0.7%) because they operate in an abstract space disconnected from visual semantics; (ii) decoder constraints
enforce on-manifold perturbations, yielding stronger adversarial training (+2.0%); (iii) using CLIP to maintain se-
mantics further amplifies gains by ensuring adversarial samples remain semantically consistent with the query text.
Together, these components establish a principled framework for self-adversarial training in UMMs.
4.5
Case Study
We provide case studies on both understanding and generation tasks for qualitative analysis.
Understanding tasks. Figure 5a illustrates four challenging categories of visual reasoning tasks: object counting,
object interaction, spatial relation and location, and crowd object detection. UniGame outperformed the baseline mod-
els in all scenarios. For instance, in C4 (crowd object detection), dense and overlapping objects in crowded scenes
challenge both localization and recognition. The baseline produces vague or incorrect answers, whereas UniGame
maintains accuracy by learning from decoded adversarial samples that emphasize occlusion and clutter. These im-
provements align with our quantitative gains, confirming that UniGame systematically addresses decision-critical
reasoning failures rather than merely fitting to benchmark statistics. And we evaluate the open-ended captioning task
in Figure 5a, the qualitative examples align with our quantitative gains on benchmarks, and suggest that UniGame
helps the model move toward semantically richer and accurate descriptions. More analysis is in Appendix E.1.

Table 5: UniGame can be plugged into an existing post-training pipeline with modest extra training to jointly improve
understanding, generation, and unification. Starting from a RecA-trained model Harmon 1.5B, we further train with

Generation tasks.
Figure 5b compares generations from the same prompts before and after post-training with
UniGame. Overall speaking, UniGame helps UMMs to generate more faithful, accurate, and stylistic images. For
instance, on the synthetic shapes example, the baseline model already produces plausible objects but often violates
fine-grained layout constraints (e.g., incorrect left/right ordering or cube–sphere counts), whereas UniGame yields
images that respect the specified 2 × 2 red cube stack, the correct number of blue spheres, and the spatial relations
such as “on the left / on the right” and “between”. More explanations of other cases are in Appendix E.2. Together
with the understanding cases, it suggests that UniGame enhances cross-modal consistency without sacrificing, and in
some cases even improving the generation quality.
4.6
Extensibility and Efficiency
UniGame remains agnostic to UMM architectures and is computationally efficient compared to other post-training
methods. In this section, we evaluate its generality and efficiency using the full set of VQAv2 on 2×H100 (80 GB)
with mixed precision. Unless noted otherwise, we use image generation size=384 and a global batch size of 8.
Extensibility. We first implement UniGame as a complement to RecA [37]. The results in Table 5 show consistent
performance gains. Specifically, UniGame outperforms the original RecA by 0.5 on MMMU for understanding and
1.27 on UnifiedBench for consistency, while remaining the same on GenEval. These results indicate that UniGame
can serve as a lightweight, plug-and-play post-training module that can be integrated into existing pipelines, requiring
only minimal additional computation.
In addition to RecA, we further constructed two architectures: (1) UMM-1 uses a Qwen2.5-VL [44] backbone with
a SigLIP2 [46] understanding encoder and a Stable Diffusion-1.5 [33] image branch; (2) UMM-2 keeps the vi-
sion/generation stack unchanged and replaces the backbone with GPT-OSS [26]. Since GPT-OSS is designed for texts,
we inserted a trainable 2-layer MLP that projects vision embeddings into the language space. Table 6 demonstrates that
UniGame is agnostic to model architectures and can improve the performance of all three different backbones. More-
over, the gains are achieved with fewer trainable parameters (e.g., ∼0.45% for UMM-2 and ∼1.43% for UMM-1),
indicating its parameter-efficient generalization.
Efficiency. We further evaluate the efficiency of UniGame in comparison with RecA [37] and UAE [43] on MMMU.
Table 7 shows that while achieving stronger performance, UniGame uses fewer trainable parameters, indicating its
efficiency over existing post-training approaches.
4.7
Convergence and Hyperparameter Analysis
Finally, we present a large-scale analysis on the convergence and hyperparameters (e.g., the hard buffer threshold
τ, trade-off β, and perturbation budget δ; see Figure 11). To study the training dynamic, we also conduct extensive
ablation study on the learning rates of two major minmax opponents in Figure 6b. Further, we systematically study the
minimax dynamics by visualizing the optimization trajectory of each run. The best configuration yields a well-behaved
minimax trajectory, where the two players alternate smoothly without divergence (see Appendix 9). We also probe
the self-play dynamics between the two opponents and clearly observe the interaction: the two branches alternately
dominate the training objective, exhibiting a stable tug-of-war behavior, and change of dominance, see Figure 10 and

Conclusion and Limitation
UniGame is the first self-adversarial post-training framework to improve the consistency of UMMs. It formulated a
minimax optimization game of the understanding and generation branches, thus enabling the model to autonomously
discover its own failures. UniGame consistently showed increased consistency, performance, and robustness, high-
lighting the great potential of optimizing UMMs within the models for further improvement.
Limitations. This work has following limitations. First, we primarily evaluate Janus-Pro-7B; broader model coverage
may reveal additional insights. Second, we use a limited set of datasets, and future work should test UniGame on more
diverse and challenging benchmarks.

Training and Testing Data
Data volumes. Unless otherwise noted, we follow the official training/evaluation splits and report results on the
standard benchmarks. Training uses VQAV2 train-split [11] is a large-scale visual question answering benchmark
(hundreds of thousands of image–question pairs) collected from MS-COCO images with crowd-sourced free-form
answers; it emphasizes grounded visual reasoning under natural images. CC3M [35] (training only) is a large web-
scale image–caption corpus (∼3M pairs in the full set); we use a filtered subset of 100k as text–image supervision for
the generative branch.
Benchmarks. We briefly introduce the benchmarks:
• VQAv2 test-dev [11]: the official VQAv2 test-dev split contains 104 000 questions; evaluation is via the
online server.5
• MMMU [45]: a college-level, multi-discipline benchmark with 11 500 questions in total (we report on the
official test set).
• POPE [17]: object-hallucination evaluation with a balanced, image-grounded design; the test split has 9000
QA pairs.
• MMBench [20]: curated multiple-choice suite; dev 1164 and test 1784 questions (4:6 split of ∼3K).
• GenEval [8]: object/layout/attribute–focused T2I evaluation with 553 prompts (reference-free automatic
checks).

• UnifiedBench [43]: unification score via caption→reconstruction; Protocol-1 uses 100 source images.
• WISE [23]: knowledge-informed T2I evaluation with 1000 structured prompts across 25 subdomains.

used splits include ∼5123 val / ∼23 399 test).
B.2
Hyperparameter Details
Optimization details. UniGame is like the current UMMs post-training, is an end-to-end method and involves de-
coding images in each batch, to balance performance and cost. Our optimizations are as followed. We use AdamW
optimizers with learning rates for Generation (gen_lr) and Understanding (und_lr). We conduct extensive ablation
on the learning rate ratio between these two components (detailed in Appendix C and Table 8), ultimately finding that
a ratio of approximately 250 achieves optimal performance (gen_lr= 5×10−3, und_lr= 2×10−5).
We implement mixed precision for training, given that Uni-Game only learned and uses small-norm perturbation, in-
sufficient numerical precision can quantize away the perturbation’s gradients and wash out all the supervision. We
vary the Generation and understanding update ratio in {1:1, 1:5, 1:10}. We performed a precision ablation compar-
ing fp16-all, bf16-all, tf32-enabled, fp32-all, fp16(G)+fp32(loss), and bf16(G/D)+fp32(loss), and
found that our final choice—computing the perturbation update, regularizer, and losses in float32 while running
the remaining forward/backward in bfloat16—consistently achieved the best stability–efficiency trade-off and the
highest robust accuracy. We force all computations that determine the perturbation and its supervision to float32.
Gradient norms and per-role clipping are also applied in FP32, and optimizer states remain FP32 (AdamW default).
All other forward/backward passes (vision tower, diffusion decoder, and LLM blocks) run under bfloat16 autocast
for throughput. This preserves the perturbation signal while retaining the speed benefits of mixed precision.
B.3
Perturber
Network architecture of C.
We implement the perturber C as a lightweight three-layer MLP that operates on each
fused visual token after the language model. The first two layers have the same width as the UMM hidden size
and apply non-linear transformations that refine the token representation and extract a direction in the shared visual-
token space. The third layer acts as a direction head, mapping the hidden representation back to the token space and
indicating along which semantic direction each token should be pushed to maximally challenge the understanding
branch. In parallel, C maintains a single learnable scalar gate ε, shared across tokens and constrained within the
perturbation budget [0, εmax], which controls the overall perturbation strength. In this way, one part of C is responsible
for discovering semantically adversarial directions, while the scalar gate ε controls how strongly these directions are
applied, keeping the module compact (with |θC| ≪min(|θU|, |θG|)) yet able to generate small but semantically
meaningful adversarial perturbations.
B.4
Hard Samples
UniGame added a hard sampler buffer to select only the challenging adversarial samples for training. Figure 6a shows
some challenging examples in our experiments.

Detailed Experimental Results
C.1
Learning Rate Ratio Ablation
To determine the optimal balance between the generation and understanding branches, we conduct an extensive sweep
of learning rate ratios. Table 8 lists the complete set of configurations tested.
C.2
Motivation Experiments
To find an Optimal noise level, we inject i.i.d. Gaussian noise into the projected visual tokens with σ
∈
{0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1}. We observe a sweet spot near σ ≈0.01 where VQAv2 soft accuracy slightly
increases (74.50 →75.58) before degrading at larger noise, see in Figure 7. This indicates that small, structured
embedding perturbations can beneficially modulate the shared representation.

• Object counting (C1): The baseline model fails to accurately count objects in cluttered scenes, often confus-
ing similar-looking items or missing partially visible objects. After UniGame training, the model correctly
identifies the precise count, demonstrating improved fine-grained visual attention.
• Object interaction (C2): Understanding relational semantics between objects (e.g., ”person holding um-
brella” vs. ”umbrella next to person”) requires compositional reasoning. The baseline misinterprets spatial
relationships, while UniGame correctly recognizes the interaction pattern.
• Spatial relation and location (C3): Queries about relative positions (e.g., ”left of”, ”behind”) expose fragile
spatial understanding in the baseline. UniGame’s adversarial training—which systematically perturbs spatial
layouts during decoding—hardens the model against such failures.
• Crowd object detection (C4): dense and overlapping objects in crowded scenes challenge both localization
and recognition. The baseline produces vague or incorrect answers, whereas UniGame maintains accuracy
by learning from decoded adversarial samples that emphasize occlusion and clutter.
These qualitative improvements align with our quantitative gains, confirming that UniGame systematically addresses
decision-critical reasoning failures rather than merely fitting to benchmark statistics.
In addition, we also present detailed analysis to the open-ended understanding tasks:
• Open-ended understanding. As illustrated in Figure 5a, UniGame produces more fine-grained and visually
grounded captions than the baseline. The model not only recognizes the overall scene (e.g., pizza, street sign,
animals) but also reliably captures details such as a missing pizza slice, vegetables on display at a farmers
market, a cat sitting on a windowsill looking out the window, or two sheep wearing coats standing in a field.
These examples show that adversarial self-play improves open-ended descriptions by encouraging the model
to focus on decision-critical visual evidence rather than hallucinated or overly generic content.
E.2
Case Study on Generation Tasks
We offer more detailed explanation of the text-to-image generations in Figure 5b.
• On the synthetic shapes example, the baseline model already produces plausible objects but often violates
fine-grained layout constraints (e.g., incorrect left/right ordering or cube–sphere counts), whereas UniGame
yields images that respect the specified 2 × 2 red cube stack, the correct number of blue spheres, and the
spatial relations such as “on the left / on the right” and “between”.
17

UniGame: Turning a Unified Multimodal Model Into Its Own Adversary
• In the “broccoli in a glass bowl” example, UniGame more faithfully binds multiple attributes—three pieces
of broccoli, two carrots on the side, and a clearly visible red sticker with the number “5” attached to the
bowl—demonstrating stronger compositional control.
• For the Grand Canyon scene, the baseline sometimes collapses the layered rock formations into a flatter
composition, while UniGame better preserves depth and lighting that match the prompt description.
• Finally, for the “blue-eyed Siamese cat sitting on a green velvet armchair”, UniGame produces a sharper
Siamese appearance and a more coherent green velvet texture, indicating that self-play training can improve
both semantic alignment and visual fidelity.

Convergence and Hyperparameter Analysis
F.1
Convergence
Convergence of the minimax training. The minmax setup raises the practical question: when does the game converge
and what schedules keep it stable? In our setup, only the Perturber C and LoRA adapters on the understanding branch
U are trainable; due to U’s larger capacity, it can dominate and degrade the generation module. We restore stability
by giving C a higher learning rate and using short, interleaved updates. We conducted an extensive sweep of the
Generation/Understanding update ratio in Table 8, shows gen lr = 5 × 10−3, und lr = 2 × 10−5, provides the best
clean–robust trade-off; prolonged generation phases saturate the attack success rate (ASR) before U adapts and induce
catch-up oscillations (see Figure 12 Figure 10). Conversely, when the generation overpowers U, decoded candidates
drift off-manifold and hurt clean accuracy. Thus, balance progression speeds: (i) use a slightly larger learning rate for
C than for U’s adapters, and (ii) prefer short alternations over long unilateral bursts. Full grids, curves, and ablations
are shown in Section C.
Figure 9: The best result of all of our runs, optimization path are projected to a two dimension axis.
Perturbation budget. The budget constraint εmax controls the perturbation magnitude in the token space. The results
in Appendix C show a sweetspot that inverted U-shaped performance curve Figure 7, setting εmax too small (e.g.,
0.005) produces weak perturbations that fail to expose critical reasoning failures, yielding limited robustness gains
(+1.7% on NaturalBench).
F.2
Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis
Unless otherwise noted, we fix the perturbation budget to δ = εmax = 0.02 in all main experiments, which we
found to provide a good clean–robust trade-off after sweeping δ ∈{0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10} Figure 11.
For hard-example mining, we define the hardness score H as the cross-entropy loss of the understanding branch on
decoded candidates plus a CLIP-based hinge term, and select hard samples using a quantile-based threshold: the buffer
threshold τ is set to the 60-th percentile of H within each mining batch, while additionally enforcing a minimum text–
image CLIP similarity of 0.6 to filter out semantically off-manifold generations. The trade-off coefficient β in Eq. (6),
which weights the contribution of buffer samples relative to clean examples, is set to β = 0.5 by default so that roughly

half of the understanding gradient comes from adversarial or hard instances; we observed that UniGame is numerically
stable for a broad range of β ∈[0.3, 1.0]. The hard-sample replay buffer stores up to 50 decoded images ranked by
H. We deliberately keep the capacity moderate, as substantially larger buffers (e.g., ≫104 entries) would store many
full-resolution decoded images and quickly lead to a steep increase in GPU and host memory usage, without providing
noticeable additional benefits in practice.

Theoretical Insights
In this section, we provide preliminary theoretical justification for why the proposed minimax self-play procedure im-
proves (i) the stability of the understanding branch, (ii) convergence of the alternating optimization, and (iii) coverage
of the shared generative manifold. The analysis is intentionally model-agnostic and applies to a broad class of unified
multimodal architectures.

where the perturber maximizes the understanding loss while the understanding head minimizes both clean and adver-
sarial losses, subject to a bounded perturbation ∥δ∥≤εmax in the shared token space. In this subsection, we analyze
an idealized version of this minimax problem to provide theoretical intuition, rather than a full convergence proof for
the actual deep network implementation.
Assumption 1 (Lipschitz continuity).
The understanding loss ℓU(a | z, q) is L-Lipschitz continuous in the token
embedding z and continuously differentiable in θU.
Assumption 2 (Bounded perturbation set and parameter domain).
The perturber operates within a compact,
convex set
D = {δ : ∥δ∥≤εmax}.
(9)
19

UniGame: Turning a Unified Multimodal Model Into Its Own Adversary
Figure 12: Dominance timeline. The trajectory alternates between understanding and generation phases, illustrating a
stable tug-of-war rather than collapse to either side during training.
Moreover, the parameter sets ΘU and ΘC for θU and θC are assumed to be compact and convex.
Assumption 3 (Local nonconvex–concave structure).
For any fixed θU ∈ΘU, the function θC 7→L(θU, θC) is
(locally) concave on ΘC in a neighborhood of the stationary points of interest. Equivalently, the game is nonconvex
in θU and (locally) concave in θC around those points.
Proposition 1 (First-order stationary point and stability).
Under Assumptions 1–3, the minimax problem in
Eq. (8) admits at least one first-order stationary point (θ∗
U, θ∗
C), i.e.,
∇θU L(θ∗
U, θ∗
C) = 0,
∇θCL(θ∗
U, θ∗
C) = 0.
Moreover, for sufficiently small learning rates (ηU, ηC), gradient descent–ascent generates a bounded sequence and
converges to a neighborhood of a first-order stationary point of L.
Sketch of proof.
By Assumption 2, the feasible set in (θU, θC, δ) is compact and convex, so a minimax solution and
hence a first-order stationary point exist. Assumption 1 guarantees that the loss is smooth in θU, and Assumption 3
provides a local nonconvex–concave structure: for each fixed θU, the objective is (locally) concave in θC. Under
such smooth nonconvex–concave conditions, standard results for two-player minimax optimization show that gradient
descent–ascent with sufficiently small step sizes (ηU, ηC) generates a bounded sequence and converges to an O(ηU +
ηC) neighborhood of a first-order stationary point of L.
Implication.
These assumptions suggest that the adversarial self-play dynamics are stable and tend not to diverge,
even though the perturber and understanding branches pursue opposing objectives.
G.2
Robustness Improvement via Worst-Case Regularization
For a fixed sample z from the shared representation space, the creator seeks a worst-case perturbation
max
∥δ∥≤εmax ℓU(z + δ).
(10)
Using a first-order Taylor expansion around z, we obtain
ℓU(z + δ) ≈ℓU(z) + δ⊤∇zℓU(z).
(11)
The optimal perturbation under the norm constraint is
δ⋆= εmax
∇zℓU(z)
∥∇zℓU(z)∥.
(12)
Substituting δ⋆into Eq. (11) and taking expectation over the data distribution yields the expected adversarial loss

UniGame: Turning a Unified Multimodal Model Into Its Own Adversary
Proposition 2 (Implicit gradient regularization).
Adversarial self-play is equivalent, to first order, to adding a
Jacobian-norm penalty:
LU,adv = LU + λ εmax E

∥∇zℓU(z)∥

.
(14)
Consequently, the understanding branch is encouraged to reduce its sensitivity to small perturbations in z, leading to
locally flatter decision boundaries.
Implication.
This explains the empirically observed improvements in robustness: the understanding head learns to
be less sensitive to challenging input variations, improving both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance as
well as adversarial robustness.
G.3
Manifold-Expanding Effect of Decoder-Constrained Perturbations
Unlike conventional pixel-space adversarial training, UniGame produces decoder-constrained adversarial examples
˜x = G(z + δ),
˜x ∈M,
(15)
where G is the decoder and M is the decodable image manifold. This architecture ensures adversarial samples are:
1. On-manifold: ˜x remains realistic and visually plausible;
2. Semantically valid: filtered by CLIP-based or similar consistency criteria;
3. Near boundary regions: targeted towards regions where the understanding model is fragile.
Assumption 3 (Local bi-Lipschitz decoder).
The decoder G is locally bi-Lipschitz on the relevant region of the
token space, i.e., there exist constants 0 < m ≤M < ∞such that for all z1, z2 in a neighborhood Z,
m∥z1 −z2∥≤∥G(z1) −G(z2)∥≤M∥z1 −z2∥.
(16)
Lemma 1 (Adversarial manifold expansion).
Under Assumption 3, for any z ∈Z the support of the perturbed
output distribution satisfies
supp(G(z + D)) ⊇supp(G(z)),
(17)
and expands the empirical training distribution toward regions where ∥∇zℓU(z)∥is large.
Implication.
The decoder-constrained perturbations induce a structured “inflation” of the data manifold towards
decision boundary regions where the understanding head is uncertain. The hard-sample buffer B collects such samples,
which are approximately located near the understanding decision boundary. Training on B reduces the empirical risk
in these critical regions:
ˆRadv = 1
|B|
X

ℓU(x)
(18)
acts as a surrogate for minimizing the out-of-distribution risk ROOD.
G.4
Summary of Theoretical Insights
The above analysis provides a theoretical lens on the benefits of the UniGame framework:
1. Convergence of self-play: Alternating gradient descent–ascent admits a stationary saddle point under mild
smoothness and compactness assumptions.
2. Robust optimization view: The adversarial creator implicitly enforces a gradient-norm penalty (Eq. (14)),
flattening the understanding decision boundary.
3. Manifold expansion: Decoder-constrained perturbations generate semantically valid hard samples that ex-
pand coverage of the decodable manifold towards challenging regions.
4. Alignment with empirical gains: These properties theoretically support the empirical improvements in
understanding, consistency, out-of-distribution robustness, and adversarial robustness observed in our exper-
iments.
