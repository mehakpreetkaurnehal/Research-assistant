Abstract
Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-
JEPA) learns visual representations by predicting latent em-
beddings of masked regions from visible context.
How-
ever, it treats all regions uniformly and independently, lack-
ing an explicit notion of where or in what order predic-
tions should be made.
Inspired by human visual per-
ception, which deploys attention selectively and sequen-
tially from the most informative to secondary regions, we
propose DSeq-JEPA, a Discriminative Sequential Joint-
Embedding Predictive Architecture that bridges predic-
tive and autoregressive self-supervised learning, integrat-
ing JEPA-style latent prediction with GPT-style sequen-
tial reasoning. Specifically, DSeq-JEPA (i) first identifies
primary discriminative regions based on a transformer-
derived saliency map, emphasizing the distribution of vi-
sual importance, and then (ii) predicts subsequent re-
gions in this discriminative order, progressively forming
a curriculum-like semantic progression from primary to
secondary cues – a form of GPT-style pre-training.
Ex-
tensive experiments across diverse tasks, including image
classification (ImageNet), fine-grained visual categoriza-
tion (iNaturalist21, CUB-200-2011, Stanford-Cars), detec-
tion and segmentation (MS-COCO, ADE20K), and low-
level reasoning tasks (Clevr/Count, Clevr/Dist), demon-
strate that DSeq-JEPA consistently focuses on more dis-
criminative and generalizable representations than I-JEPA
variants.

dence on costly annotation for training. Early approaches,
such as contrastive learning [2, 3, 5], instance discrimina-
tion [6], or masked image modeling [1, 7, 8], have shown
that representations learned in this way can rival or even
surpass those trained with human supervision. Neverthe-
less, most existing SSL approaches either contrast different
augmented views of the entire image or reconstruct masked
pixels at the raw level. While the former emphasizes global
invariance and the latter focuses on local appearance recov-
ery, both objectives primarily operate at either the image or
pixel level, offering little incentive to model how informa-
tion is organized within an image. Consequently, they tend
to capture either holistic or low-level statistics rather than
structured, semantic relationships across regions.
Recently,
Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures
(JEPAs) [9] have revisited the foundations of SSL. In-
stead of contrasting instances or reconstructing pixels,
JEPAs directly predict latent embeddings of masked regions
from visible context, offering a scalable and information-

Figure 2. (A) I-JEPA learns to predict the embeddings of the target regions (y1, . . . , yN) from a single context region x, using a predictor
network conditioned on latent variables z. While (B) DSeq-JEPA learns to predict the embeddings of the next discriminative regions {R2,

preserving formulation.
The image-based variant, I-
JEPA [10], learns what to represent by modeling con-
text–target relationships within the same image and has
demonstrated impressive performance across a range of vi-
sual tasks. Its idea is simple: from a single context region,
predict the embeddings of various target regions in the same
image, as shown in Figure 2 (A). However, I-JEPA treats all
regions equally and lacks an explicit notion of where or in
what order predictions should be made, overlooking that
visual information is inherently structured.
Humans, by contrast, perceive scenes selectively and se-
quentially, as shown in Figure 1. Visual attention acts as
a dynamic filtering mechanism that enables humans to effi-
ciently process the vast amount of information in complex
scenes. Models of human vision [11] suggest that human
gaze follows a series of information-seeking fixations, with
each next fixation location attempting to minimize uncer-
tainty (maximize information) about the stimulus. In other
words, our fixations are sequential and focus on the most
discriminative regions, shifting attention from primary to
secondary cues, naturally guiding fine-grained representa-
tion learning. Motivated by this, we ask:
Can predictive self-supervised models learn not only what
to predict, but also where and in what order to predict?
To answer this question, we revisit predictive self-
supervised learning through the lens of discriminative se-
quencing, moving beyond static prediction toward an or-
dered reasoning process. Accordingly, we propose DSeq-
JEPA (Discriminative Sequential Joint-Embedding Predic-
tive Architecture), a new paradigm that learns not only what
to predict, but also where and in what order, introducing a
discriminative sequential inductive bias (DSeq Bias) that is
(loosely) motivated by human perception. This paradigm
bridges two previously distinct lines of self-supervised
learning: predictive modeling (JEPA-style) and autoregres-
sive reasoning (GPT-style). In doing so, DSeq-JEPA refor-
mulates representation learning as a progressive discovery
process of discriminative regions in semantic space through
two synergistic components, as illustrated in Figure 2.
• Selective Region Gazing (Where to attend): Unlike I-
JEPA’s uniform region sampling, DSeq-JEPA dynam-
ically identifies and prioritizes discriminative regions
(e.g., bird beak, wing patterns) using a similarity-based
saliency map. These regions are selectively attended
and iteratively refined during pre-training, mimicking
human visual attention that focuses on information gain.
• Sequential Region Prediction (In what order): De-
parting from I-JEPA’s flat, independent prediction of re-
gions (BERT-style pre-training [12]), DSeq-JEPA em-
ploys a successive prediction process (GPT-style pre-
training [13]) where the model sequentially predicts em-
beddings for regions from the most discriminative to the
least. This encourages semantically structured repre-
sentations, where discriminative cues are captured early,
while contextual details are integrated progressively.
We evaluate DSeq-JEPA across diverse visual tasks.

to dense prediction tasks such as detection and segmenta-
tion (MS-COCO [18], ADE20K [19]), and object counting
and depth prediction (Clevr/Count, Clevr/Dist [20]). Qual-

tends to and predicts next discriminative regions, producing
interpretable, fine-grained representations. Overall, our re-
sults indicate that predictive self-supervised learning bene-

2. Related Work
Self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained significant atten-
tion in recent years, particularly in the context of visual rep-
resentation learning. Existing SSL methods can be cast into
the framework of Energy-based Models (EBMs) [21], and
partitioned into three categories: Joint-Embedding Archi-
tectures (JEAs), Generative Architectures (GAs), and Joint-
Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs).
JEAs are designed to bring the embeddings closer to-
gether for compatible inputs, and push the embeddings fur-
ther apart for incompatible ones. JEA methods include: (i)
contrastive learning approaches, e.g., SimCLR [3], MoCo
[2], MoCo v2 / v3 [5, 22], SwAV [23], form the foundation
of this paradigm, optimizing instance-level discrimination
via large batches or memory banks; and (ii) non-contrastive
approaches, e.g., BYOL [24], SimSiam [4], further show
that meaningful representations can emerge even without
negative samples, relying instead on asymmetric prediction
and momentum encoders to avoid collapse.
GAs aim to reconstruct a target signal y from a related
input signal x by employing a decoder network. This pro-
cess often incorporates additional variables z, which may be
latent, to enhance the reconstruction. Masked image mod-
eling serves as a prominent technique in this category, with
notable examples that include MAE [1], BEiT [7], SimMIM
[8], and iGPT [25], where models learn to fill in masked re-
gions of an image. Such methods encourage learning low-
and mid-level features that are useful for reconstruction but
may not directly align with semantic discriminability.
JEPAs [9], on the other hand, formulates self-supervised
learning as a predictive problem in latent embedding space,
i.e., predicting the embedding of a target signal y from a
compatible input signal x through a predictor network that
leverages additional (potentially latent) variables z to im-
prove the prediction process. As an instantiation of this ar-
chitecture, I-JEPA [10] is proposed to improve the semantic
level of self-supervised representations. Given an image, a
context encoder processes the visible regions while a target
encoder extracts latent embeddings for the masked ones. A
lightweight predictor then predicts the target embeddings
based on the context features, and training minimizes a
latent-space regression loss between the predicted and true
embeddings. This design discards pixel-level reconstruc-
tion and contrastive pairing, enabling scalable, information-
preserving pretraining that focuses on high-level semantics
rather than low-level texture statistics. C-JEPA [26] inte-
grates I-JEPA with contrastive objectives to stabilize train-
ing and better align invariances. These predictive architec-
tures demonstrate strong abstraction capabilities but treat all
regions uniformly, lacking an explicit mechanism to deter-
mine which regions are most discriminative or in what or-
der to predict them. Our DSeq-JEPA is based on I-JEPA
but aims to improve the capabilities of JEPA-based methods
for fine-grained representation learning. Compared with I-
JEPA, (i) DSeq-JEPA biases prediction toward discrimina-
tive regions by prioritizing where to attend, whereas I-JEPA
samples target regions uniformly without regard to their dis-
criminativeness, and (ii) DSeq-JEPA performs prediction in
a sequential and discrimination-guided manner, explicitly
modeling in what order to predict, whereas I-JEPA follows
a flat, unordered prediction process.
3. Methodology
Our goal is to enhance self-supervised learning by intro-
ducing a preferential strategy for predictive region selec-
tion and by imposing an explicit order on these predic-
tions, inspired by human visual perception. To this end,
we introduce DSeq-JEPA, which operationalizes the DSeq
Bias within the I-JEPA family, extending it toward selective
and sequential discriminative reasoning, thereby bridging
predictive and autoregressive paradigms in self-supervised
learning. Figure 3 illustrates that DSeq-JEPA consists of
three modules: (i) Attention Generation: Produces a spatial
saliency map that highlights informative regions. (ii) Dis-
criminative Region Selection: Identifies significant regions
adaptively based on the saliency map, determining where to
look. (iii) Next Discriminative Region Prediction: Guides
the model to learn fine-grained representations by focusing
on pre-identified regions, modeling in what order to predict.
3.1. Model Architecture
Following I-JEPA [10], our model also has three modules:
a context encoder fϕ, a target encoder f ¯ϕ, and a predictor
gθ, all built upon the Vision Transformer (ViT) [27]. The
context and target encoders follow the standard ViT de-
sign, while the predictor is implemented as a lightweight
ViT variant.
In our experiments, we employ ViT-B/16
and ViT-L/16 as backbones to verify the effectiveness and
scalability of DSeq-JEPA. While the overall architecture
closely follows I-JEPA, we append an auxiliary class token
to both the context and target encoders following MAE [1]
to maintain architectural consistency with ViT-based down-
stream tasks. This token acts as a stable semantic reference
that slightly improves the reliability of attention-based re-
gion selection without altering the predictive formulation
or training objective of I-JEPA. Conceptually, it serves only
as a lightweight anchor for attention aggregation rather than
a structural modification. We verified that this modification
alone brings no gain in Section 4.5.
3.2. Attention Generation
To determine where to attend, we generate a saliency
map that highlights informative regions in the input image.
Specifically, we pass the image through the target encoder

Figure 3. Overview of DSeq-JEPA. We compute a saliency map for each input image, identify the Top-N high-response regions (with N=3
for illustration), and feed them to the predictor sequentially. During prediction, each region’s embedding is predicted from its preceding
regions and positional tokens, and aligned with its target encoder embedding. All encoders and predictors adopt ViT [27] architecture.
f ¯ϕ and compute a similarity map between the auxiliary class
token and all patch embeddings at a specific transformer
block. The resulting similarity values indicate each patch’s
contribution to the global semantics, where regions with
higher value correspond to more informative content rele-
vant for understanding the image.
Formally, given an image x ∈RC×H×W , we feed it
into the target encoder f ¯ϕ, obtaining feature embeddings
s = f¯ϕ(x) ∈RD×h×w, where D is the embedding di-
mension, and h, w denote the number of vertical and hori-
zontal patches, respectively. We compute a similarity map
A ∈Rh×w between the embeddings of the class token and
all patches at the l-th transformer block. While we use this
simple similarity-based attention for region selection, the
formulation is general and can accommodate other attention
mechanisms that provide spatial guidance.
3.3. Discriminative Region Selection
Given the saliency map A from the target encoder, we ex-
tract a set of high-saliency regions that indicate discrimina-
tive visual evidence. Local maxima of A are detected and
ranked, yielding a series of discriminative regions. This
procedure treats internal attention as a learnable notion of
visual importance, enabling the model to localize informa-
tive areas without any external saliency supervision. Recent
work [28, 29] further supports this view, showing that learn-
able tokens in ViTs can implicitly function as information
banks, an emergent, self-organizing property of transformer
representations. We first normalize the saliency map:
˜A =
A −min(A)
max(A) −min(A).
(1)
An adaptive threshold τ is then determined by Otsu’s
method [30], yielding a binary mask:
M(i, j) = 1
h
˜A(i, j) ≥τ
i
.
(2)
We apply connected-component labeling to M under a re-
laxed connectivity criterion (8-neighborhood) to obtain the
candidate set {Rk}. Under this relaxed condition, each Rk
may consist of multiple spatially separated (mutually dis-
joint) sub-regions. Small components (|Rk| < α hw) are
discarded, where α is a small constant. Each region is as-
signed a discriminative score:
ρk =
1
|Rk|
X
(i,j)∈Rk
˜A(i, j).
(3)
4

Unlike prior works [9, 26], we employ irregular, non-
overlapping masks for the extracted regions.
We select
the top-(N −1) regions with the highest ρk values and
form R = {Rk}N
k=1, where N=5 following I-JEPA. The
last region RN is defined as the remaining area: RN =
Ω\ SN−1
k=1 Rk, where Ωdenotes the full image region.
This ensures complete coverage of the image without gaps,
yielding more stable and discriminative region-based repre-
sentation learning.
Since saliency maps are often noisy during the early
stages of pre-training, we adopt a probabilistic curriculum
to stabilize optimization. The probability λ of applying dis-
criminative selection is linearly increased from 0 to 1 over
pre-training epochs, so that for each sample we apply I-
JEPA’s random region sampling with probability 1 −λ and
our discriminative selection with probability λ. This pro-
gressive transition helps the model evolve from diffuse at-
tention to structured saliency, effectively allowing it to learn
where to look.
3.4. Next Discriminative Region Prediction
In this stage, we enhance self-supervised representations
through a sequential predictive mechanism that models dis-
criminative regions in an autoregressive manner. Specifi-
cally, given a set of the most discriminative regions in an
image {Rk}N
k=1, where the index reflects their ordering by
discriminativeness, our goal is to enable our predictor to
possess such an ability that predicts the representation of the
(k+1)-th most discriminative region, Rk+1, conditioned on
the previously encoded top-k discriminative regions. The
predicted representation is expected to align closely with
its true representation, i.e., the output embedding obtained
by feeding Rk+1 to the target encoder. In this process, we
predict the representations of regions 2 through N, each
conditioned on all preceding regions in the sequence. We
formulate this prediction process as follows. For each step
k ∈{1, . . . , N−1}, the predictor gθ estimates the (k+1)-th
region embedding as
ˆsRk+1 = gθ(pRk+1, sR1, . . . , sRk),
(4)
where sR1, . . . , sRk denotes the representations of the
1, . . . , k-th most discriminative regions from the context
encoder, respectively, pRk+1 is the mask positional token
for the predicted discriminative region, and N indicates the
number of most discriminative regions. gθ is a learned pre-
dictor, and ˆsRk+1 is the predicted representation of the next
discriminative region, which is expected to align closely
with its true representation sRk+1 from the target encoder.
Unlike I-JEPA’s flat predictions, this formulation intro-
duces causal dependencies among regions, mirroring the
progressive reasoning by which humans integrate salient
cues into global understanding. It thus unifies JEPA-style
latent prediction with GPT-style autoregression, enabling a
progressive reasoning process over discriminative regions.
From an information-theoretic perspective, sequential pre-
diction can be viewed as an active information-seeking pro-
cess: each step attends to the region expected to contribute
the most new information given the previously encoded re-
gions. This progressive reduction of representational uncer-
tainty aligns with human visual perception, where attention
shifts sequentially to maximize information gain.
3.5. Optimization Objective
To enforce the alignment between the predicted representa-
tion ˆsRk+1 and its ground-truth counterpart sRk+1, we adopt
the smoothed ℓ1 (Huber) loss:
Lpred = 1

(6)
This objective encourages stable yet discriminative align-
ment between predicted and target embeddings, making the
sequential prediction both smooth and robust to outliers.
4. Experiments
4.1. Evaluation Tasks
Following I-JEPA and C-JEPA, we pre-train all models on
ImageNet-1K [14], and conduct linear probing and fine-
tuning across diverse benchmarks to assess DSeq-JEPA’s
generalization and discriminative ability: (1) Image clas-
sification: linear probing evaluation on ImageNet-1K [14].
(2) Fine-grained visual categorization:
iNaturalist21
(iNat21) [15], CUB-200-2011 (CUB) [16], and Stanford-
Cars (Cars) [17] to test fine-grained recognition that is sen-
sitive to local regions. (3) Object detection and instance
segmentation: transfer learning on MS-COCO [18] using
Mask R-CNN [31] as the detector. (4) Semantic segmen-
tation: evaluation on ADE20K [19] with the Semantic FPN
and UPerNet head [32] as in [1]. (5) Low-level reason-
ing: Clevr/Count (object counting) and Clevr/Dist (depth
prediction) [20] to assess structured scene understanding.
4.2. Implementation Details
Our pre-training and downstream evaluation strictly follow
the configurations of I-JEPA [10] and C-JEPA [26]. Further
details are presented in the supplementary material.
4.3. Main Results
Across diverse tasks ranging from coarse-grained recogni-
tion to fine-grained categorization, dense prediction, and
structured reasoning, DSeq-JEPA consistently achieves the
best performance among I-JEPA variants, demonstrating its
strong generalization and representational capability.

4.3.1. Image Classification
Following I-JEPA and C-JEPA, to validate the effectiveness
of DSeq-JEPA, we first conduct experiments on ImageNet-
1K under linear probing. Linear probing is a commonly
adopted evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning,
where a linear classifier is trained on top of the frozen fea-
tures extracted by the pre-trained model. The classification
accuracy reflects the quality of the representation learned
through the SSL approach. As shown in Table 1, using a
ViT-B/16 backbone, DSeq-JEPA achieves 73.5% Top-1 ac-
curacy, outperforming I-JEPA by +1.1%. The gain is con-
sistent when scaling to the ViT-L/16 model, where DSeq-
JEPA reaches 77.9%, exceeding I-JEPA by +0.8%. These
improvements confirm that modeling where to attend and
in what order to predict leads to more discriminative latent
representations, effectively balancing global semantic ab-
straction and local discriminative focus during pre-training.
C-JEPA combines I-JEPA with contrastive learning.
DSeq-JEPA achieves the same or nearly identical results
(equal on ViT-B/16 and only 0.1% lower on ViT-L/16).
When augmented with the same contrastive regularization,
DSeq-JEPA+Contrastive outperforms C-JEPA, highlighting
that discriminative region selection and sequential predic-
tion offer complementary benefits and stronger robustness.
We highlight that while average improvements of +0.9%
to +1.2% may appear modest, they are consistent and sig-
nificant (both in statistical and application sense). For com-
parison, the improvements of C-JEPA [26] over I-JEPA [10]
on ImageNet are smaller (+0.8% with ViT-B/16 and +0.6%
with ViT-L/16); the average improvement on C-JEPA over
I-JEPA is even smaller (+0.3% and -0.1%), so about 1/3 of
what we achieve with DSeq-JEPA.
4.3.2. Fine-grained Visual Categorization (FGVC)
The fundamental challenge in the FGVC task lies in distin-
guishing visually similar sub-categories (e.g., within birds,
Indigo Bunting vs. Lazuli Bunting), which requires mod-
els to capture subtle discriminative part features such as
feather coloration, beak morphology, and tail length [33].
To test the discriminative precision of learned represen-
tations, we further evaluate on FGVC benchmarks, in-
cluding iNaturalist21 (10,000 distinct species) [15], CUB-
200-2011 (200 bird species) [16], and Stanford-Cars (196
car models) [17]. DSeq-JEPA consistently outperforms I-
JEPA and C-JEPA across all FGVC datasets.
For ViT-
B/16, it achieves 36.4% on iNat21, 66.2% on CUB, and
67.3% on Cars, surpassing I-JEPA by +0.5%, +0.9%, and
+1.4%, and C-JEPA by +0.2%, +1.3%, and +1.2%. When
equipped with the same contrastive regularization as C-
JEPA, DSeq-JEPA+Contrastive further improves to 36.6%
/ 66.5% / 67.4%, outperforming C-JEPA by +0.4%, +1.6%,
and +1.3%, respectively. Similar trends are observed for
ViT-L/16, where DSeq-JEPA and DSeq-JEPA+Contrastive
achieve better performance than I-JEPA and C-JEPA. Over-
all, the consistent performance across both ImageNet and
FGVC benchmarks demonstrates the generality of DSeq-
JEPA. By modeling where and in what order to attend,
DSeq-JEPA learns representations that are not only effec-
tive for coarse-grained categorization but also highly trans-
ferable to tasks requiring fine-grained discrimination.

4.3.3. Detection and Segmentation
To further evaluate the transferability of the learned rep-
resentations to dense prediction tasks, we perform object
detection and instance segmentation on MS-COCO and
semantic segmentation on ADE20K using the pre-trained
ViT-B/16 models. As shown in Table 2, DSeq-JEPA con-
sistently outperforms I-JEPA across all metrics, achiev-
ing +0.6 APbox, +0.5 APmask, and +0.5 mIoU improve-
ments. When equipped with the same contrastive regular-
ization, DSeq-JEPA+Contrastive attains the best overall re-
sults. While the absolute gains are moderate, this is ex-
pected given the strong C-JEPA baseline and the limited
sensitivity of dense prediction heads to pre-training vari-
ations.
Importantly, the consistent improvements across
both detection and segmentation demonstrate that discrimi-
native sequential prediction promotes more spatially struc-
tured and semantically coherent representations, which gen-
eralize well beyond classification to pixel-level prediction.
4.3.4. Low-level Reasoning
As shown in Table 3, on low-level reasoning tasks, DSeq-
JEPA with ViT-L/16 yields 86.4 on Clevr/Count and
71.5 on Clevr/Dist, improving over I-JEPA by +0.8 and
+0.3, respectively. With contrastive regularization, DSeq-
JEPA+Contrastive reaches 87.1 / 71.9, surpassing C-JEPA.
The fact that improvements persist on these low-level
metrics indicates that DSeq-JEPA does not merely en-
hance semantic categorization, but also strengthens geomet-
ric/structural priors in the representation.
4.4. Ablation Study
We conduct a series of ablation experiments to analyze
the contribution of each component in DSeq-JEPA. Specif-
ically, we study how selective region generation and se-
quential prediction contribute to overall performance, and
whether their combination produces synergistic effects.
Table 4 summarizes the impact of each component us-
ing linear probing on ImageNet and iNat21 with pre-trained
ViT-B/16 model. The baseline configuration (uniform sam-
pling + flat prediction) corresponds to I-JEPA, where all

regions are treated equally and predicted in parallel. En-
abling only one of the two components degrades perfor-
mance.
Sequential prediction alone (uniform + sequen-
tial) slightly degrades accuracy. This indicates that, without
an informative order, autoregression introduces noise: the
model commits to an arbitrary prediction path that is not
aligned with discriminative content. Conversely, discrimi-
native selection alone (selective + flat) also underperforms,
while the model focuses on discriminative regions, predict-
ing them in parallel collapses the structure of inter-region
dependencies. From a learning dynamics perspective, our
sequential prediction can be viewed as an easy-to-hard cur-
riculum. The most discriminative regions contain the most
informative cues, making them easier to predict and more
stable.
By conditioning subsequent predictions on these
strong representations, the model gradually learns to infer
less discriminative and more context-dependent regions. In
contrast, random or unordered prediction (selective + ran-
dom sequential) disrupts this natural progression, forcing
the model to learn from mixed difficulty signals and thus
degrading performance. Importantly, combining both (se-
lective + sequential), DSeq-JEPA achieves the best results.
These findings demonstrate that the two modules are not in-
dependently effective, but rather synergistic: discriminative
region selection provides a semantically meaningful trajec-
tory (where to attend), and sequential prediction exploits
this trajectory to capture region-to-region causal dependen-
cies (in what order to predict). Together they yield more
discriminative and fine-grained representations.
4.5. Effect of Class Token
To ensure architectural consistency with I-JEPA, we intro-
duce an auxiliary class token solely as an anchor for gener-
ating saliency maps, without adding extra layers or param-
eters. As shown in Table 5, incorporating the [CLS] token
does not improve I-JEPA’s performance, demonstrating that
the improvements of DSeq-JEPA originate from the pro-
posed discriminative and sequential learning mechanisms,
rather than from any architectural modification.

4.6. Visualization Analysis
Comparison with I-JEPA.
As shown in Figure 4, I-JEPA
produces relatively diffuse attention patterns and rectangu-
lar target masks, often covering multiple unrelated and over-
lapped areas. In contrast, DSeq-JEPA generates compact,
semantically meaningful regions with order, progressively
focusing on the most discriminative parts of an object (e.g.,
the bird’s beak and forehead), leading to a clearer region
correspondence and improved interpretability.
Evolution during Pre-training.
Figure 5 visualizes how
patch-level clustering in the learned representation space
evolves as pre-training progresses. This reflects how DSeq-
JEPA’s representations self-organize during pre-training,
where patches with similar semantics gradually become
closer, even under a fully unsupervised setting.
As pre-
training progresses, from early stages to later ones, the ini-
tially fragmented and noisy groupings gradually evolve into

coherent, object-aligned clusters. This emergent behavior
indicates that DSeq-JEPA explicitly captures fine-grained
semantic structure through its attention-guided learning dy-
namics, without requiring any supervision or external con-
straints.
5. Conclusion
We proposed DSeq-JEPA, extending JEPAs with selective
and sequential prediction mechanisms. By explicitly mod-
eling where to attend and in what order to predict, DSeq-
JEPA progressively activates discriminative cues and cap-
8

tures structured, fine-grained representations. Comprehen-
sive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate
consistent gains over JEPAs, confirming DSeq-JEPA’s ro-
bustness and generality. Our findings highlight that selec-
tive attention and sequential reasoning are synergistic in-
ductive biases for predictive representation learning, align-
ing more closely with human perception. In future work, we
will explore integrating DSeq-JEPA into vision–language
pre-training to enable more structured visual–textual align-
ment and selective cross-modal grounding.

DSeq-JEPA: Discriminative Sequential Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture
Supplementary Material
6. Implementation Details
6.1. Pre-training
Optimization Strategy.
For optimization, we follow the
same setting as I-JEPA [10] and C-JEPA [26], using the
AdamW [34] optimizer with cosine learning rate schedul-
ing and warmup strategy, which starts from 1e-4 and lin-
early warmup until 1e-3 during first 15 epochs and ends at
1e-6. Also, we tuned the weight decay value with cosine
annealing, which starts from 4e-2 and ends at 4e-1. We ini-
tialized the target-encoder weights with the context-encoder
weights, and updated the parameters of the target encoder
by an exponential moving average (EMA) with decay fac-
tors increasing from 0.996 to 1.0.
Training Protocol.
We pre-train DSeq-JEPA for 600
epochs. The input images were resized to 224 × 224 pix-
els, with a global batch size of 2048. Data augmentation
techniques included random resized cropping with a ran-
dom scale within [0.3, 1.0]. Following I-JEPA, we do not
use hand-crafted data augmentations such as horizontal flip-
ping, Gaussian blur, and color distortion. In Section 3.2,
the saliency map is obtained from the 10-th layer, and in
Section 3.3, α = 0.15 is used to discard small connected
regions. Masks for all discriminative regions were sampled
at a scale between 0.15 and 0.2, ensuring a minimum of
10 patches per mask. We set the number of regions to 5,
the same with I-JEPA. Overlapping between masks is not
allowed. We set the window size to 3 in the max pooling
operation.
Computational Resources.
We used 8 H200 GPUs with
140 GB of memory. The use of 8× H200 was opportunistic,
not required.
6.2. Downstream Evaluation
Image Classification.
We use the ImageNet-1K [14] vali-
dation subset for evaluating learned representations in large-
scale benchmark. As in [10, 26], we train a linear head
on the full training set, where we use concatenated fea-
ture maps from the last four transformer blocks. The lin-
ear head was configured with batch normalization and op-
timized using SGD with a momentum of 0.9, Nesterov ac-
celeration, and a weight decay of 5 × 10−4. Training was
conducted for 28 epochs with a base learning rate of 0.01,
scaled automatically by batch size, and scheduled via a
multi-step decay at epochs 8, 16, and 24 (learning rate val-
ues: 0.01 →0.001 →0.0001 →0.00001). A batch size of
32 per replica was used, with random resized crop augmen-
tation (crop size 224 from resized 256-pixel images).
Fine-grained Visual Categorization.
For fine-grained
visual categorization, we use iNaturalist21 [15], CUB-200-
2011 [16], Stanford-Cars [17], and as ImageNet linear-
probing, we train a linear classifier in same setting.
Detection and Segmentation.
For object detection, we
fine-tune a Mask R-CNN detector [31] with an FPN on MS-
COCO 2017 [18], reporting APbox and APmask on val2017
following the standard COCO protocol. The convolutional
backbone is replaced by a ViT encoder pretrained with
DSeq-JEPA , as in [1, 10]. We fine-tune the entire model
end-to-end for 25 epochs with AdamW, a base learning rate
of 1.0 × 10−4, weight decay 0.1, using linear warmup in
the first epoch followed by cosine decay, a global batch size
of 16. For the ViT backbone we use stochastic depth with
maximum drop-path rate 0.1, and otherwise adopt default
Mask R-CNN hyperparameters from the underlying detec-
tion framework.
For semantic segmentation on ADE20K, we adapt a
UPerNet-style decoder with a ViT-Base backbone pre-
trained using DSeq-JEPA. We extract feature maps from
pre-trained model at 3, 5, 7, and 11 layers, and pass them
into decoder. We train and evaluate with an input crop size
of 512 × 512, and use a sliding-window inference strategy
with a 512×512 crop and a stride of 341×341. The model
is optimized with AdamW with a learning rate of 1 × 10−4,
a weight decay of 0.05.
Low-level Tasks.
For compositional reasoning on Clevr
[20], we evaluate DSeq-JEPA representations on the Clevr-
Count and Clevr-Distance tasks from VTAB-1k. We use a
ViT-based backbone pretrained with DSeq-JEPA and freeze
the target encoder during downstream training. Each image
is resized to an input resolution of 224×224 and fed into the
backbone; we take the final-layer [CLS] token as a global
image representation and pass it through a task-specific lin-
ear classification head. Clevr/Count and Clevr/Distance are
treated as 8-way and 6-way classification problems, respec-
tively. We follow the standard VTAB-1k data split, using
800 images for training, 200 images for validation, and
15,000 images for testing for each task. The linear heads
are optimized with AdamW with a learning rate of 1×10−3,
a weight decay of 0.05, a batch size of 256, and we train for
100 epochs using a cosine learning rate schedule.

7. Implementation of Discriminative Region
Selection
For completeness, Algorithm 1 summarizes the implemen-
tation of our discriminative region selection with a prob-
abilistic curriculum. Given the saliency map A from the
target encoder, we first normalize it, extract connected com-
ponents, and rank the resulting regions {Rk} by their dis-
criminative scores (Equation (1)-Equation (3) in the main
paper). We then select the top-N regions as discrimina-
tive candidates. During pre-training epoch t, we compute
a mixing probability λ that linearly increases from 0 to 1,
and for each region index k we either use the discriminative
region Rk with probability λ or a randomly sampled block
region R(u, v, w, h) with probability 1−λ. This per-sample
Bernoulli mixing implements the curriculum described in
Section 3.3 of the main paper.

8.1. Effect of Prediction Order
Table 6 revisits the ablation on prediction order using ViT-
B/16 pre-trained on ImageNet. The results for I-JEPA (flat),
random order, and our sequential order are identical to those
reported in the main paper (Table 4); here we addition-
ally evaluate a spatial order variant, where the same set of
discriminative regions is sorted by the coordinates of their
centers and predicted from left to right and top to bottom
(row-major scan), i.e., according to image geometry struc-
ture rather than discriminativeness. We observe that random
order performs slightly worse than the flat I-JEPA baseline
(71.7% vs. 72.0%), spatial order brings only a small im-
provement (72.7%), while our discriminative sequential or-
der achieves the best accuracy (73.5%). This shows that
autoregression alone is not sufficient: when the prediction
order carries no useful information (random), it can even
hurt performance; a purely geometric order provides some
signal but limited benefit, whereas a semantically meaning-
ful prediction trajectory over discriminative regions is cru-
cial for DSeq-JEPA to fully improve the learned represen-
tations.

8.2. Sensitivity to the Number of Regions N
We fix the number of regions to N = 5 in the main exper-
iments, following the I-JEPA setting. To assess sensitivity
to this choice, we vary N ∈{3, 5, 7} for DSeq-JEPA with
ViT-B/16 and pre-train on ImageNet under the same sched-
ule. Table 7 reports linear probing accuracy on ImageNet.
We find that DSeq-JEPA is robust for the number of dis-
criminative regions, and the overall performance fluctuates
little. Using too few regions (N = 3) slightly under-utilizes
contextual information, while increasing to N = 7 brings
no further benefit and even reduces accuracy by 0.1% com-
pared to N = 5, despite the additional complexity. Over-
all, it can be concluded that DSeq-JEPA is a stable self-
supervised learning algorithm.
8.3. Per-step Prediction Difficulty
To better understand the effect of discriminative sequenc-
ing, we analyze the prediction loss at different steps of the
region sequence. Using the DSeq-JEPA ViT-B/16 check-
point at epoch 450, we sample 10,000 ImageNet images
and, for each Top-k region prediction, compute the average

loss. As shown in Figure 6, early steps (Top-2 and Top-
3) exhibit lower prediction error, while later steps (Top-4
and Top-5) are clearly harder, with noticeably higher loss.
This pattern is consistent with our interpretation that order-
ing regions by discriminativeness induces an implicit easy-
to-hard curriculum: the model first predicts highly infor-
mative, stable regions and then gradually moves to weaker
or more context-dependent regions. In turn, the sequential
predictor leverages this trajectory to structure the learned
representations.

8.4. Pre-training Time Overhead
Table 8 reports the pre-training time on ImageNet with ViT-
B/16 under the same hardware and training configuration.
Compared to I-JEPA (24.2h) and C-JEPA (24.5h), DSeq-
JEPA requires 26.5h, i.e., roughly a 9% increase in wall-
clock time.
This overhead is modest and mainly comes
from computing the similarity-derived saliency map and se-
lecting a small number of discriminative regions (N = 5).
Given the consistent gains across ImageNet, FGVC, dense
prediction, and low-level reasoning benchmarks, we view
this additional cost as practically acceptable.
8.5. Additional Visualizations
In Figure 5, we visualize the evolution of patch-level clus-
tering on a few training images with 4 clusters and ob-
serve that DSeq-JEPA progressively organizes patches into
semantically meaningful groups.

havior generalizes beyond the training set and to explore

Consistent with the training examples, DSeq-JEPA encour-
ages patches with similar semantics to be grouped together
into compact, coherent clusters. These results further sup-
port our claim that discriminative sequencing leads to more
structured and interpretable patch-level representations.
