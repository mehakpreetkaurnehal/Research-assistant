Abstract
Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a
promising approach for aligning text-to-image generative
models with human preferences. A key challenge, however,
lies in designing effective and interpretable rewards. Ex-
isting methods often rely on either composite metrics (e.g.,
CLIP, OCR, and realism scores) with fixed weights or a
single scalar reward distilled from human preference mod-
els, which can limit interpretability and flexibility. We pro-
pose RubricRL, a simple and general framework for rubric-
based reward design that offers greater interpretability,
composability, and user control. Instead of using a black-
box scalar signal, RubricRL dynamically constructs a struc-
tured rubric for each prompt—a decomposable checklist of
fine-grained visual criteria such as object correctness, at-
tribute accuracy, OCR fidelity, and realism—tailored to the
input text. Each criterion is independently evaluated by a
multimodal judge (e.g., o4-mini), and a prompt-adaptive
weighting mechanism emphasizes the most relevant dimen-
sions.
This design not only produces interpretable and

modular supervision signals for policy optimization (e.g.,
GRPO or PPO), but also enables users to directly adjust
which aspects to reward or penalize. Experiments with an
autoregressive text-to-image model demonstrate that Rubri-
cRL improves prompt faithfulness, visual detail, and gen-
eralizability, while offering a flexible and extensible foun-
dation for interpretable RL alignment across text-to-image
architectures.
1. Introduction
Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a
promising approach for aligning generative models [3, 6–
8, 21, 31, 32, 35–37, 39, 41] with human preferences. In
large language models, frameworks such as RLHF [29]
and RLVF [34, 55] have demonstrated that policy optimiza-
tion guided by preference-based feedback can significantly
enhance faithfulness, style, and usability. Extending this
paradigm to text-to-image generation, including both dif-
fusion and autoregressive (AR) architectures, offers a prin-
cipled way to optimize models directly for human-aligned
visual quality rather than likelihood-based objectives. How-
ever, the effectiveness of RL in visual domains critically

depends on reward design: constructing evaluation signals
that are accurate, interpretable, and generalizable across
prompts, domains, and architectures remains a core chal-
lenge.
Existing text-to-image RL frameworks can be broadly
categorized into multi-reward mixtures and unified scalar
reward models. Multi-reward systems (e.g., X-Omni [14],
AR-GRPO [56]) combine heterogeneous objectives, such as
CLIP-based image–text similarity [30], OCR accuracy [9],
realism [51], and attribute consistency, to jointly encourage
alignment and visual quality. While such approaches im-
prove coverage, they depend on manually tuned weighting
schemes that can be brittle across prompts and domains, and
offer limited interpretability. Unified reward models (e.g.,
OneReward [15], Pref-GRPO [45], LLaVA-Reward [58])
instead learn a single scalar reward from pairwise human
preference data. This simplifies optimization but can ob-
scure the reasoning behind rewards, limit extensibility, and
make it difficult for users to control which visual aspects are
prioritized.
In this paper, we propose RubricRL, a simple and gen-
eral framework for rubric-based rewards design in text-to-
image models. Rather than relying on opaque scalar signals,
RubricRL dynamically selects a structured rubric for each
prompt, i.e., a decomposable checklist of fine-grained vi-
sual criteria such as object correctness, attribute accuracy,
OCR fidelity, compositional coherence, and realism. Each
criterion is independently evaluated by a multimodal judge
(e.g., GPT-o4-mini), while a prompt-adaptive weighting
mechanism highlights the most relevant dimensions. This
produces interpretable, modular supervision signals that in-
tegrate naturally into policy optimization frameworks such
as GRPO [19] or PPO [33].
By expressing rewards in human-readable and decom-
posable form, RubricRL transforms reward evaluation from
a black-box heuristic into an auditable process, where users
can directly inspect, extend, or adjust which aspects of gen-
eration are rewarded or penalized. The rubric structure also
facilitates per-criterion diagnostics, providing transparency
into model behavior and simplifying both evaluation and
debugging.
RubricRL is architecture-agnostic and compatible with
both diffusion and autoregressive text-to-image models.
The rubric outputs further support variance-aware group ad-
vantages, leading to robust updates even under long-horizon
rollouts. Its prompt-adaptive design ensures that each re-
ward vector reflects the salient aspects of the input text, such
as numerals, named entities, styles, or embedded text, with-
out requiring manual tuning.
We validate this simple yet effective idea using an AR
text-to-image model. Experiments show that RubricRL im-
proves prompt faithfulness, compositional accuracy, and vi-
sual realism, while maintaining high generalizability across
datasets and architectures. Compared to prior multi-reward
or unified-reward approaches, RubricRL achieves more
consistent optimization behavior and enables controllable,
interpretable reward shaping. Figure 1 provides visualiza-
tion samples of our method, illustrating high visual quality.
In summary, RubricRL contributes:
• A generalizable rubric-based reward design applicable to
both diffusion and AR text-to-image models;
• A prompt-adaptive, decomposable supervision frame-
work that enhances interpretability and composability;
• A user-controllable and auditable interface that makes RL
reward shaping transparent and easily extendable.
By operationalizing alignment through dynamically gen-

erated rubrics of explicit visual criteria, RubricRL makes
reinforcement learning for text-to-image generation more
interpretable, extensible, and user-guided, offering a uni-
fied foundation for aligning visual generation with human
intent.

Methods.
Text-to-image
(T2I) generation has seen significant progress through both
diffusion-based [5, 17, 28, 32, 48, 50] and autoregressive
(AR) architectures [11, 49, 54, 57].
Diffusion models
iteratively refine latent representations conditioned on text
prompts, achieving high-quality and photorealistic images.
Variants such as Stable Diffusion [32] and flow-based
extensions [13, 26] provide diverse styles, controllable
generation, and strong fidelity at both global and local
levels.
Autoregressive approaches, on the other hand,
represent images as sequences of discrete tokens and model
the joint distribution of text and image tokens using a
single transformer backbone. Early hybrid designs, such
as DreamLLM [11], paired AR text encoders with separate
diffusion decoders. More recent unified AR models, in-
cluding Chameleon [25], Emu3 [44], TransFusion [57], and
Janus [49], integrate visual tokenization and autoregressive
modeling in one architecture. These models allow direct
mapping between text tokens and visual outputs, enabling
flexible control and fine-grained generation. In this paper,
we propose a novel reward design for reinforcement
learning in text-to-image models, and demonstrate their
effectiveness using a unified AR text-to-image model.
However, our rubric-based rewards are applicable to both
AR and diffusion architectures
Reinforcement Learning for Text-to-Image Generation.
Maximum-likelihood training often under-optimizes user-
salient qualities, such as semantic faithfulness, composi-
tional accuracy, and aesthetics.
Reinforcement learning
(RL) offers task-aligned feedback that directly optimizes for
human-relevant properties beyond likelihood. In diffusion-
based text-to-image models, RL methods, such as Flow-
GRPO [27], DanceGRPO [52], and reasoning-augmented
T2I-R1 [24], have improved alignment by fine-tuning the
generative policy with preference or metric-based rewards.
Recently, RL has also been applied to unified AR T2I mod-
els [43], where policy gradients act directly on next-token
probabilities, enabling end-to-end credit assignment and
fine-grained control over generated images.
The design of the reward function is central to effec-
tive reinforcement learning in text-to-image models. One
line of work aggregates heterogeneous signals—such as
CLIP-based image–text alignment [30], OCR/text correct-
ness [9, 47], multimodal VLM judges (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-
32B [4]), aesthetic and realism metrics [53], and human-
preference surrogates [51].
While comprehensive, these
multi-reward mixtures demand careful weighting and tun-
ing, which can destabilize optimization and obscure per-
aspect failures. Another direction trains unified preference
models [45, 46, 58] to predict a single scalar human-aligned
score from paired image outputs, simplifying optimization
but relying on costly human annotations and limited scal-
ability.
In this work, we propose a rubric-based reward
that is simple, generalizable, and interpretable. For each
prompt, a compact rubric defines aspect-wise criteria—such
as text alignment/OCR accuracy, object count, spatial re-
lations, and overall coherence/quality.
Each criterion is
scored independently by a dedicated evaluator, and a trans-
parent aggregation produces the final reward. This design
is more prompt-adaptive, decomposable, and interpretable,
while providing user-controllable and auditable feedback.
While several concurrent works [18, 23] investigate rubric-
based rewards in natural language processing, to the best of
our knowledge, we are the first who proposes rubric based
rewards in in text-to-image RL.
3. Method
In this paper, we use an AR based text-to-image model to
verify the effective of our RubricRL framework, however
it is generalizable to diffusion based model as well. This
section starts by introducing the overall architecture of our
RubricRL framework, followed by more details about the
design of reburic based reward, RL training method and dy-
namic rollout sampling.
3.1. Overall architecture
As illustrated in Figure 3, given an input text prompt p,
we first tokenize it into a sequence of text tokens, which
are then fed into an autoregressive (AR) text-to-image gen-
eration model πθ to predict a sequence of image tokens.
These image tokens are subsequently decoded using a pre-
trained, fixed VQ decoder to produce the final image I.
In this paper, we primarily focus on post-RL fine-tuning
of πθ to further enhance its output quality, where design-
ing an effective, reliable, and interpretable reward func-
tion is the key challenge. Existing methods typically em-
ploy one or multiple specialized models to evaluate different
aspects of image quality, such as CLIP-based image–text
semantic alignment reward [30] (Rclip(I, p)), OCR accu-
racy [9](Rocr(I, p)), and realism [51]. However, this ap-
proach has notable drawbacks: (1) deploying multiple spe-
cialized models is computationally expensive and difficult
to scale to additional aspects; (2) it requires careful reward
calibration and reweighting. Recent works have attempted
to learn a single reward model from pairwise human pref-
erence data, simplifying optimization but offering limited
extensibility due to high annotation costs and poor inter-
pretability.

Figure 3. Overview of the proposed method. We propose a simple, general rubric generation pipeline and rubric-based reward model for
unified text-to-image generation.
pabilities of modern multimodal LLMs such as GPT-5, we
propose a simple and unified rubric-based reward model,
denoted Rrubric(I, p, C(p)).
This model replaces the en-
semble of task-specific evaluators with a single reasoning-
capable vision–language model (VLM). Rather than re-
lying on fixed sub-models, our approach automatically
constructs a set of interpretable, prompt-adaptive criteria
termed “rubrics” that capture the essential aspects of qual-
ity requirements for each specific prompt p.
In detail, given a text prompt p, a Rubric Generation
Model G (implemented via a large language model) gen-
erates a set of evaluation rubrics:
C(p) = G(p),
(1)
where C(p) = {c1, c2, . . . , cM} defines M prompt-specific
criteria encompassing dimensions such as object count, at-
tribute accuracy, text/OCR fidelity, spatial relations, aes-
thetics, and style consistency. This ensures that the eval-
uation criteria dynamically adapt to the semantics and gran-
ularity of each input prompt.
In reinforcement learning (RL), the objective is to adjust
the model parameters θ to maximize expected rubric based
reward over the distribution of prompts:
max
θ
Ep∼D, I∼πθ(·|p)

Rrubric(I, p, C(p))

,
(2)
where D denotes the set of prompts. A rollout corresponds
to a single sampled image from πθ given p, providing a re-
ward signal that guides policy updates. Compared to multi-
model reward systems, our rubric-based formulation offers
three key advantages: (1) Simplicity: it eliminates the need
for multiple task-specific graders; (2) Adaptivity: rubrics
are dynamically generated for each prompt, ensuring rele-
vance to diverse user intents; and (3) Interpretability: each
reward component corresponds to a human-readable evalu-
ation criterion, enabling transparent model diagnostics and
controllable optimization.
3.2. Rubric based reward
The rubric based reward function proceeds in two stages.
First, a Rubric Generation Model G interprets the user
prompt p and produces a set of candidate evaluation rubrics
C(p). Second, a multimodal LLM grader implements the
Rubric-Based Reward Rrubric(I, p, C(p)) that scores a gen-
erated image I against each rubric in C(p). In this paper,
we employ GPT-o4-mini to fulfill both roles, generating
prompt-specific rubrics and providing per-criterion judg-
ments that are aggregated into a scalar reward.
Rubric construction. Given a user prompt p, we ask GPT-
o4-mini to generate a list of rubrics. Each rubric entry con-
tains a short eval key that targets a specific aspect (e.g., OCR
alignment, object count, spatial relations, aesthetics) and a
concise description of what to check in the image.
To promote diversity and reduce positional bias during
rubric generation, we randomly permute the evaluation as-

pects in the rubric generation prompt and query GPT-o4-
mini multiple times. In each round, the model produces a
set of rubrics (we request 10 per query; because a prompt
may describe multiple objects or attributes, the model may
output multiple rubrics for one eval key to ensure adequate
coverage). We aggregate all valid key–criterion pairs across
runs into a unified rubric pool, discarding ambiguous or
malformed entries. Finally, to remove redundancy and fo-
cus on the most important signals, we ask GPT-o4-mini to
choose the top-10 most relevant and critical criteria for eval-
uating images generated from the user prompt p.
Rubric-guided reward. Given a generated image I, its cor-
responding text prompt p and the rubric pool C, we simply
ask GPT-o4-mini again to output a single score yi ∈{0, 1}
for each criteria to reflect whether the generated image fully
satisfies this rubric (yi = 1) or not (yi = 0). The overall
rubric reward is computed as the normalized mean of:
R(I, p, C) = 1
M

3.3. Reinforcement learning with GRPO
To align the autoregressive image generator with rubric-
based rewards, we employ Group Relative Policy Opti-
mization (GRPO) [34], a variant of PPO designed for sta-
ble optimization over grouped rollouts. For each prompt,
the set of generated rollouts forms a group, and the reward
of each rollout is normalized relative to the group to reduce
variance and improve credit assignment. Concretely, let πθ
denote the current policy and Ri the rubric reward for roll-
out i in group g. GRPO computes the relative advantage
Ai =

and updates the policy by maximizing a clipped objective
similar to PPO:
L(θ) = Ei

i
,
(5)
where ri(θ) =
πθ(ai|si)
πθold(ai|si), ai and si are the sampled ac-
tion and state corresponding to rollout i, and ϵ is the PPO
clipping parameter. By leveraging this group-relative ad-
vantage, GRPO stabilizes training across prompts, making
the model robust to heterogeneous reward scales and noisy
evaluations. Combined with our rubric-based reward and
dynamic rollout selection strategy described below, we find
GRPO can effectively guide the generative model toward
images that are both human-aligned and high-quality.
3.4. Dynamic rollout sampling
As discussed above, the target policy model πθ in GRPO
explores the generation space by sampling multiple roll-
outs, each yielding a reward Ri used for advantage compu-
tation. In the original GRPO design, all N rollouts from
a single prompt are grouped together for policy updates,
i.e., |g| = N. Subsequent works introduce over-sampling
and filtering strategies to improve training efficiency. For
instance, DAPO [55] adopts a prompt-level over-sampling
approach: it generates N rollouts per prompt and discards
prompts whose rollouts all have accuracy 1 or 0, thereby
retaining only moderately difficult prompts for policy opti-
mization. Formally, DAPO selectively sample prompts used
in training while still using all rollouts from each retained
prompt for RL updates.
In this paper, we propose a new rollout-level dynamic
sampling mechanism, where selection occurs within the
rollouts of a single prompt rather than filtering entire
prompts. Specifically, given a text prompt, instead of sam-
pling only N rollouts, we oversample N ′ rollouts (N ′ > N)
and selectively use a subset of N representative rollouts for
policy updates. To balance quality and diversity, we adopt
a hybrid selection strategy: we take the top-K high-reward
rollouts and randomly sample the remaining N −K rollouts
from the others to encourage diversity. Formally, the rollout
group g is constructed as
g = {τ(1), . . . , τ(K)} ∪RS
 {τ(K+1), . . . , τ(N ′)}, N−K

,
where RS denotes random sampling. Empirically, we ob-
serve this hybrid design achieves a better balance between
stability and diversity, achieving better model quality. As a
result, the loss in Eq. 5 is computed over a more represen-
tative and informative subset of rollouts, leading to more
consistent and efficient learning compared to both the orig-
inal GRPO and the prompt-level filtering scheme in DAPO.
4. Experiments
4.1. Implementation details
Following SimpleAR [43], we select 11,000 images from
JourneyDB [38] and Synthetic dataset-1M [12] and recap-
tion the images using GPT-o4-mini to generate different
prompt length per image and randomly pick up during
training. For the network architecture, we use two LLM,
i.e., Phi3-3.8B [1] and Qwen2.5-0.5B [40] that have been
SFT trained as the backbone, and use LlamaGen’s VQ de-
coder [39] and Cosmos-Tokenizer [2] as the visual decoder
respectively. RL training is performed with TRL frame-
work [42] at a learning rate of 1e-5 with a 0.1 warm-up ratio.
The datasets are trained with a batch size of 28 for 3 epochs
by default. The resolutions of output images in two back-
bones are 512 and 1024, respectively. For dynamic roll-
out sampling, we select 4 candidates from 16 rollouts per
prompt. During inference, we leverage the classifier-free
guidance (CFG) [20] to guide image synthesis based on the

conducted on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.
4.2. Comparing with state-of-the-arts
We compare RubricRL with multiple reward models across
aforementioned two text-to-image SFT models on DPG-
Bench [22] and GenEval [47]. The compared reward meth-
ods can be grouped according to their reward design: 1) a
single specialized reward model, including CLIPScore [30],
HPSv2 [51], Unified Reward [46], and LLaVA-Reward-
Phi [58]; and 2) composite reward metrics with fixed
weights, such as AR-GRPO [56] and X-Omni [14]. For
fair comparison, we obtain the baseline numbers by im-
plementing their methods and use the same RL framework
(GRPO) and settings, while the only difference is the de-
sign of reward functions. For better understanding gains
brought by RL, we also report the performance of the ini-
tial SFT model, on top of which each RL reward is inde-
pendently applied. Quantitative results using both Phi3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones are reported in Table 1 and Table 2.
For GenEval, prompt rewriting is applied following [10]
to ensure evaluation consistency. From the results, all RL
post-trained methods consistently outperform the SFT base-
line, confirming the benefit of reinforcement learning in en-
hancing image generation quality. And RubricRL achieves
the best performance, surpassing X-Omni by approximately
4% on GenEval on both LLM backbones, highlighting the
effectiveness and generalization of our rubric-based reward.
4.3. Ablation study
In this section, we conduct multiple ablation analysis. By
default, all experiments are based on Phi3 and evaluated on
the GenEval benchmark .
Strategies for dynamic rollout sampling.
To investigate
the impact of different selection strategies used by dynamic
rollout sampling, we compare four methods, i.e., RubricRL

without dynamic rollout sampling (Vanilla), FFKC-1D [16],
DAPO [55], and our proposed hybrid strategy, and report
the results in Table 3. Specifically, FFKC-1D also over-
samples more rollouts and then keeps a diverse subset by
first selecting a medoid (the rollout with reward closest to
the median) and then greedily adding samples that max-
imize reward distance from already chosen ones.
Com-
pared to our hybrid strategy, FFKC-1D focuses too much
on the diversity and ignore the importance of high quality
rollouts. As shown in Table 3, our hybrid sampling strat-
egy consistently achieves the best performance, surpassing
both FFKC-1D and DAPO as well as the Vanilla baseline
that directly uses four rollouts without any dynamics. In-
terestingly, FFKC-1D and DAPO do not outperform the
vanilla baseline, suggesting that their dynamic prompt sam-
pling and pure rollout diversity-driven sampling strategies
fail to provide additional informative signals for RL. In con-
trast, our hybrid strategy effectively balances exploitation of
high-reward rollouts and exploration of diverse candidates,
enabling the policy model to leverage both higher-quality
and diverse samples, resulting in more effective RL signal.
Normalization scope for advantages.
In Eq. 4, the ad-
vantage used in GRPO is computed by normalizing re-
wards—using the mean and standard deviation—within a
group of rollouts. Under our dynamic sampling strategy,
only N rollouts are retained out of N ′ candidates. This
raises an important design choice: should the normalization
statistics (mean and standard deviation) be computed using
all N ′ rollouts or only the retained N? We denote these two
variants as “Global Norm” and “Local Norm”, respectively.
In Table 4, it reflects that “Local Norm” yields better perfor-
mance. This is because normalizing within the retained sub-
set better reflects the actual reward distribution that guides
learning, preventing high-variance or low-quality rollouts
from distorting the gradient direction.

model equipped with a Best-of-N sampling strategy dur-
ing inference(N = 8), which has been observed in prior
work [14] to form a ‘upperbound’ for RL methods in lan-
guage tasks. Specifically, for each prompt in GenEval, we
first generate a rubric, then sample 8 rollouts from the SFT
model. Each rollout is scored using the rubric-based re-
ward, and the top 4 are selected for evaluation on GenEval.
As shown in Table 5, although Best-of-N sampling signifi-
cantly can achieve higher scores, RubricRL still achieves a
notable improvement, exceeding it by over 5%. This result
aligns with the observations in X-Omni [14], reconfirming
that reinforcement learning provides a more effective opti-
mization paradigm.
Failure case analysis.
As the grader, although GPT-o4-
mini is highly general and powerful in evaluating the qual-
ity of generated images, we observe that it can assign in-
correct scores—e.g., underestimating or overestimating ob-
ject counts, particularly when the base model’s generation
quality is poor. Figure 4 illustrates several typical failure
cases in the counting subcategory of GenEval, such as re-
dundant poles near traffic lights, intertwined bicycles, and
overlapping zebras. These challenging scenarios often mis-
lead GPT-o4-mini, resulting in inaccurate counts. However,
when the base model generates higher-quality images, this
issue is less pronounced. This explains why RubricRL’s
performance on the “counting” subcategory in GenEval
and the “Other” subcategory in DPG-Bench—both contain-
ing many counting cases—is worse than the baseline SFT
model when using Qwen2.5-0.5B as the base model. In
contrast, with Phi3-3.8B, this issue almost disappears, al-
lowing RubricRL to substantially improve performance in

“In a tranquil forest clearing by the water's edge, a large orange tent with its entrance zipped shut is pitched on a grassy knoll overlooking a 
serene lake. A few steps away from the tent, on the forest floor scattered with autumn leaves, a acircular gold bracelet catches the sunlight, 
creating a subtle sparkle amid the natural surroundings. The nearby trees cast gentle shadows over the area, enhancing the peaceful ambiance 
of the outdoor scene.”
“An intricately detailed oil painting depicts a raccoon dressed in a black suit with a crisp white shirt and a red bow tie. The raccoon stands 
upright, donning a black top hat and gripping a wooden cane with a silver handle in one paw, while the other paw clutches a dark garbage 
bag. The background of the painting features soft, brush-stroked trees and mountains, reminiscent of traditional Chinese landscapes, with a 
delicate mist enveloping the scene.”
“A ripe, golden pineapple sits centered on a light wooden table, with a single green-bottled beer to its left and a pair of identical bottles to 
its right. The beers have droplets of condensation on their surfaces, indicating they are chilled. The pineapple's spiky green leaves contrast 
with the smooth, cylindrical shape of the beer bottles.”
“An eye-catching vibrant red pickup truck with a stout and rectangular build is parked on the sandy shores as dusk sets in. The truck's glossy 
paint contrasts with the soft, amber hues of the setting sun reflected off the vehicle's surface. In the background, the gentle waves of the 
ocean can be heard as they meet the beach, with the silhouette of palm trees swaying gently in the evening breeze.”
Figure 5. Qualitative comparison: we visualize RubricRL and baseline models using prompts from DPG. RubricRL shows superior
image quality that is both aesthetically pleasing and better aligned with the prompt. The bold text highlights key elements that RubricRL
successfully captures, while baseline models often fail to generate these details accurately.
counting-related categories.
4.4. Visual results
We further present comprehensive visual comparisons be-
tween RubricRL and other baseline approaches in Figure 5.
As illustrated, models trained with RubricRL consistently
produce images that are not only more aesthetically appeal-
ing but also demonstrate superior semantic alignment with
the given input prompts. To aid interpretation, any mis-
aligned or missing elements in the generated images are
emphasized using bold text within the figure. For exam-
ple, in the third row of Figure 5, the SFT model fails to
render the black top hat entirely, while several RL-based
methods exhibit partial misalignment. Specifically, LLaVA-
Reward-Phi [58] and Unified Reward [46] generate outputs
where the black bag is not properly held in hand, and in
some cases, depict two bags in both paws while omitting
the wooden cane altogether. These qualitative observations
underscore the effectiveness of RubricRL in enhancing the
model’s capability to follow complex, fine-grained instruc-
tions and produce high-quality, prompt-consistent images.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce RubricRL, a rubric-based re-
ward RL framework that provides prompt-adaptive, decom-
posable supervision for text-to-image generation. By ex-
plicitly creating configurable visual criteria (e.g., count-
ing, attributes, OCR fidelity, realism) and scoring them in-
dependently, RubricRL produces interpretable and modu-

lar signals that integrate seamlessly with standard policy
optimization in RL. Experimental results demonstrate that
RubricRL outperforms existing RL-based approaches for
enhancing text-to-image generation.
We hope this work
provides new insights into applying reinforcement learning
to visual generation models.

6. More ablations
6.1. Analysis of using different models as the grader.
Our method, i.e., RubricRL benefits from a high-quality
grader (GPT-o4-mini) in RL: only when per-criterion judg-
ments (e.g., counting, spatial relations, color) are accurate
does the reward become informative enough to drive use-
ful policy updates. A weak or noisy grader produces mis-
aligned signals that the policy can overfit or exploit, thereby
hurting stability and sample efficiency. By contrast, a reli-
able grader yields low-noise, goal-aligned rewards that as-
sign credit to the right behaviours and penalize specific er-
rors, making RubricRL effective.
To quantify this effect, we use different vision language
models as the grader in RubricRL and report the results in
Table 6. We choose the Qwen2.5-VL [4] family with vary-
ing model sizes (3B, 7B, and 32B) to evaluate each rollout
during training. We observe that the 32B grader clearly out-
performs both the 3B and 7B variants, confirming that a
stronger vision–language model provides more informative
and reliable rewards overall. The 7B model shows a slight
improvement over the 3B model, consistent with its higher
capacity, while the 3B grader still offers useful signals on
certain criteria (e.g., color and position). Nevertheless, both
Qwen2.5-VL graders remain noticeably weaker than the
32B grader while all Qwen2.5-VL graders still lag behind
the o4-mini grader with a clear gap, which we attribute to
o4-mini’s stronger instruction following, better multi-step
reasoning, and tighter alignment with our rubric design, re-
sulting in sharper, lower-noise per-criterion rewards and ul-
timately better downstream generation quality.
6.2. Analysis of the number of rollouts before and
after dynamic sampling.
We investigate how the oversampling budget and the post
selection budget, i.e., how many rollouts we generate in the
dynamic sampling versus how many we keep for reward
computation, affect the model’s performance.
For each
prompt, we first generate N ′ candidate rollouts (N ′ > N)
and then select N of them using our Hybrid dynamic sam-

outs and different numbers N selected). In the main paper, the
setting is N ′ = 16, N = 4.

pling strategy; the selected N samples are used to compute
the GRPO loss. All other hyperparameters remain fixed
across settings.
As shown in Table 7, increasing the oversampling bud-
get (e.g., N ′ ∈{8, 16, 32, 64} with fixed N = 4) ini-
tially improves performance by providing a larger candi-
date pool from which the Hybrid selector can identify high-
reward and diverse rollouts. However, the gains soon sat-
urate because larger N ′ also introduces higher reward vari-
ance, making advantage estimates noisier and hindering sta-
ble optimization. A similar phenomenon appears when in-
creasing the selection budget from N = 4 to N = 8: al-
though more selected rollouts increase exploitation, incor-
porating too many rollouts increases the likelihood of in-
cluding low-quality generations, amplifying variance in the
group-normalized advantage and diluting the learning sig-
nal. Notably, configurations with a 4× oversampling ra-
tio achieve comparable overall performance, indicating that
maintaining this level of oversampling is sufficient for ob-
taining high-quality candidates. Overall, both oversampling
and selection are beneficial only up to a point—beyond that,
the added diversity is outweighed by increased noise, re-
vealing an inherent trade-off between exploration and opti-
mization stability in GRPO-style training.
7. Visualization
In this section, we present additional generations from our
RubricRL. As shown in Figure 6, our RubricRL produces
high-fidelity images, and significantly improves the model’s
ability to follow complex prompts. Additionally, we visual-
ize the detailed key-criterion rubrics for each prompt, along
with the correctness or incorrectness of each rollout under
each criterion, as shown in Figure 7.

In this whimsical digital illustration, a plump 
guinea pig is rendered in a vibrant palette of 
orange, cream, navy blue, and vivid purple. Its fur 
is stylized with fine, dynamic strokes, while a 
tuft of lime green hair sweeps back over its head, 
adding playful contrast. The rodent's rosy pink 
paws and ears peek out from the dense coat, and 
its shiny black eye gleams with life. Set against a 
muted olive-green background, the guinea pig's 
rounded form and richly saturated colors create 
a charming blend of realism and fantasy, evoking 
both warmth and imaginative flair.
A tiny red squirrel nestles into a soft mound of 
fresh snow atop a moss-covered branch, its 
bushy tail curled protectively around its body. 
Fine snowflakes cling to the animal's warm fur

warm wooden walls and green-painted door and 
window shutters stand in stark contrast to the cool 
emerald hues of surrounding foliage. A gentle slope 
leads down to a crystal-clear lake, its glassy 
surface mirroring the cabin, scattered boulders, 
and the dense tree line beyond. Soft golden light 
filters through the evergreens, casting dappled 
shadows across the grassy shore, while faint sparks 
of embers or distant firelight glow within the 
woods. The scene evokes serene solitude and an 
intimate connection with nature, promising peaceful 
retreats and quiet moments by the water's edge.
Bathed in the warm hues of a surreal sunset, this 
sleek Nike soccer cleat stands out with its
