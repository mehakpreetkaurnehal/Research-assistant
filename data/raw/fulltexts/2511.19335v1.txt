Abstract 
High-throughput methods enable accelerated discovery of novel materials in complex systems 
such as high-entropy alloys, which exhibit intricate phase stability across vast compositional 
spaces. Computational approaches, including Density Functional Theory (DFT) and calculation 
of phase diagrams (CALPHAD), facilitate screening of phase formability as a function of 
composition and temperature. However, the integration of computational predictions with 
experimental validation remains challenging in high-throughput studies. In this work, we 
introduce a quantitative confidence metric to assess the agreement between predictions and 
experimental observations, providing a quantitative measure of the confidence of machine 
learning models trained on either DFT or CALPHAD input in accounting for experimental 
evidence. The experimental dataset was generated via high-throughput in-situ synchrotron X-ray 
diffraction on compositionally varied FeNiMnCr alloy libraries, heated from room temperature 

to ~1000 °C. Agreement between the observed and predicted phases was evaluated using either 
temperature-independent phase classification or a model that incorporates a temperature-
dependent probability of phase formation. This integrated approach demonstrates where strong 
overall agreement between computation and experiment exists, while also identifying key 
discrepancies, particularly in FCC/BCC predictions at Mn-rich regions to inform future model 
refinement. 
 
Introduction 
High-entropy alloys (HEAs) exhibit exceptional mechanical and high-temperature performance 
due to their characteristic high configurational entropy and stable solid-solution crystal structures 
through the “cocktail”, “sluggish-diffusion”, and lattice-distortion effects. [1,2]. For example, the 
FeNiMnCr system, a four-element derivative of the Cantor family, shows good phase stability, 
irradiation resistance, and mechanical ductility [3-5], as a promising candidate under extreme 
conditions. However, phase identification across broader compositional ranges is challenging 
[6]: multiple phases can form, and phase stability varies with synthesis techniques and 
processing temperatures. The vast synthesis parameter space comes with a complicated structure-
property relationship. For example, the appearance of intermetallic or ordered phases (e.g., σ, 
B2, L12) significantly alters the microstructure and mechanical behavior [7]. While certain 
intermetallic-containing HEAs may show enhanced hardness or strength, these secondary phases 
may also deteriorate corrosion or oxidation resistance in aqueous or high-temperature 
environments [8,9]. The phases formed may vary significantly within narrow composition and 
temperature ranges. Thus, phase identification across the full compositional and temperature 
space remains a highly complex and critical task for HEA design. 
Computational tools offer a promising route to explore phase formability and transformation 
behavior. Fundamental enthalpy and ordering insights can be determined from Density 
functional theory (DFT) [10,11], while calculation of phase diagrams (CALPHAD) provides 
equilibrium phase diagram predictions based on thermodynamic databases [12]. These 
computational methods can be further leveraged through the use of machine learning (ML) to 
build predictive models that interpolate trends found in a dense array of computationally 
calculated compo[13-15]. Despite good agreement between computational predictions and 
experiments in simpler systems [16], the fidelity of modeling complex HEAs remains uncertain, 
particularly since there are multiple variables and uncertain criteria in high-throughput 
experimental (HTE) validation of computational calculations. For instance, CALPHAD and DFT 
have predicted several phases in FeNiMnCr system though, some of those phases have yet to be 
detected in the samples fabricated by arc melting or additive manufacturing [17,18]. There has 
been limited discussion on the discrepancies in structure prediction, and the agreement and 
fidelity between a computational method and practical measurement have not been assessed.  

HTE allows one to broadly assess the validity of these computational predictions [19,20]. 
However, most previous investigations have either mapped multiple compositions at a fixed 
temperature [10,11,21] or performed in-situ diffraction on a single composition [22,23], limited 
by the constraints of available equipment [24]. Recent developments in robotic systems 
integrated with synchrotron beamlines allow sequential in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) across 
composition libraries, permitting simultaneous exploration of both temperature and 
compositional space to identify various phase transformation tendencies [25]. Such efforts can 
yield sufficient results to provide meaningful assessment and recalibration of the degree of trust 
for specific computational predictions.  
In this study, we employed in-situ synchrotron XRD to characterize phase evolution in 
FeNiMnCr HEA system across both compositional and temperature spaces. We compare those 
observations with predictions from CALPHAD- and DFT-based ML models, and we propose a 
metric that evaluates the agreement between computational predictions and experimental 
observations. This metric could also assess agreement across different datasets and weigh the 
likelihood of a theory being aligned with experiments, guiding future integrated frameworks in 
autonomous alloy discovery. 
 
Results and Discussions 
During in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD), all samples exhibited three distinct stages: 
an as-deposited metastable structure, stabilized solid solution (SS), and silicide. The stabilized 
state included not only the crystallization from amorphous structure but also the transformation 
from intermetallic (IM) to solid solution (SS) phases. In the FeNiMnCr HEA system, the formed 
SS structure is observed as either/both face-centered cubic (FCC) or/and body-centered cubic 
(BCC) phase. According to the distinct phase transformation and categories of SS formation 
types (Figure 1a), the samples could be categorized into the types at FeNi-, Cr-, and Mn-rich 
regions, as well as FeNi/Cr- and Cr/Mn-transition regions. The amorphous FeNi-rich region 
(Figure 1b) crystallized into an FCC phase, and the transformation temperature increased when 
the FeNi concentration decreased. As the Cr concentration increased (Figure 1c), a BCC phase 
appeared during crystallization while the σ phase remained stable. Here, there was no obvious 
change in transformation temperature with Cr composition. Unlike the transformation due to 
crystallization in FeNi- and Cr-rich regions, the detected transition temperatures in Mn-rich 
regions (Figure 1d) indicate the onset of grain growth from a nanocrystalline (NC) state to BCC 
structure. At the interface between the Mn-rich and Cr-rich regions (Figures 1e, f), there are two 
distinct BCC phases. At even higher temperatures, the silicon diffusion from the substrate was 
considerable [23]. The formation of silicide phases was more pronounced than the reaction with 
oxygen, as there were no detectable oxides in the XRD patterns, and the variation in HEA 
composition resulted in differing silicide phases (Figures S4 and S5).

phase transformation in pseudo pseudo-ternary diagram. (b-f) Corresponding XRD contour maps 
of phase transformation during heating. 
 
Due to the relatively high deposition rate, all the samples exhibit NC or even amorphous 
structures in the as-deposited state [26-28]. Figure 2a shows the estimated grain size for the as-
grown samples, determined from the Scherrer equation, applied to the peak width of the main 
reflection of each phase for a given composition. The as-deposited FeNi-rich samples showed the 
smallest grain size, corresponding to a fully amorphous structure. The as-deposited Mn-rich 
samples displayed an NC-BCC phase with a grain size above 3 nm. The as-deposited Cr-rich 
samples exhibited the coexistence of an amorphous phase with a σ phase, showing by far the 
largest crystallite size of any as-deposited samples. 

As the samples were heated, all as-deposited structures remained unchanged below 300 °C, 
except the FeNi-richest sample with the transformation temperature Ttran ~ 120 °C, and then 
transformed to thermodynamically stable phases at higher temperatures (Figure 2b). Cr-rich 
samples exhibit the highest crystallization temperature, and the transition temperatures in Mn-
rich regions indicate the onset of grain growth from an NC state to stabilized BCC structures. 
The difference in phase formation is attributed to the variations in composition. In this HEA 
system, FeNi composition affects the formation tendency of BCC and FCC phases, and the σ 
phase only exists in the Cr-rich region. Similar to the prior study of FeNiCr alloys [29], the 
formation of the σ phase is attributed to a high Cr composition (Table S2). Figure 2c presents a 
clear formability boundary of the σ phase based on the FeNiMn/Cr ratio: the σ phase only exists 
when the value is lower than 3. As the FeNi concentration increases, i.e., with a larger 
FeNi/MnCr ratio, samples showed the tendency to form an FCC phase while the crystallization 
temperature decreased (Figure 2d). The samples with more Mn or Cr (FeNi/MnCr < 2.2) 
exhibited a preference to form a BCC phase, which could also transform into FCC phase at 
higher temperatures. Due to the overlap of FCC and silicide peaks (Figure S4), it is difficult to 
fully index the FCC phase, and obtaining an exact ratio range of FCC+BCC phases is 
challenging. Samples with a higher FeNi/MnCr ratio formed the FCC phase as the stable solid 
solution phase, however, with a lower crystallization temperature (inserted diagram in Figure 
2d). A pure FCC phase existed with FeNi composition larger than 70%, i.e., FeNi/MnCr > 2.3. 
Overall, Fe and Ni favor FCC stabilization, whereas Cr and Mn drive BCC formation.

FeNiMn/Cr and (d) FeNi/MnCr ratios. The inserted figure in (d) shows the phase transition 
temperature as a function of FeNi/MnCr ratio. 
 
Besides the observed composition ratios from the experiment, we also evaluate the phase 
formability according to the empirical criteria [30] for HEAs (Figures 3a, 3b, and S6). The 
empirical omega-atomic radius mismatch (Ω-δ) relationship (Figure 3a) considers the 
equilibrium state of materials, and all FeNiMnCr samples were in the SS region, corresponding 
well to the phases in the stabilized state (500-700 °C). The existence of the σ phase in Cr-rich 
samples aligns with the criteria for intermetallic (IM) formation. It should be noted that the σ 
phase is observed in the characterization, and the IM phase indicates the predicted structure in 
empirical principles or computational simulations. Considering the as-deposited samples 
(inserted diagram in Figure 3a), the characterized amorphous phase existed in the region with a 
lower Ω value. It corresponds well to the criteria for forming metallic glass structures, though 
with a relatively higher Ωvalue than that of the empirical rules. The electronegativity mismatch 
Δχ and the mixture valence electron concentration (VECmix) are common parameters to consider 
the formability of stable SSs (Figure 3b). The stable FCC phase exists when VEC ≥ 8.4; the 
tendency to form the BCC phase increases when VEC decreases [30,31]. Additionally, FCC 
tends to exist when Δχ is small while BCC forms with larger Δχ values, and a clear IM region 
exists in the medium Δχ range, where σ and Laves phases form with SS structures [32]. Hence, 
the phase stabilization trend aligns well with empirical rules. 
The energy above the convex hull for FeNi-based quaternary HEAs over Fe-Ni-Mn-Cr-Co-Al-Si 
space was used as input in the Random Forest (RF) model to train a hybrid DFT-ML 
framework.[33,34] The total energy was computed at 0 K without considering vibrational 
entropy. The estimated transformation points from ordered intermetallic to disordered solid 
solution were calculated as a function of temperature from the ideal configurational entropy for 
the quaternary space (Figure S1). The result reveals a unique intermetallic formability tendency 
within the FeNiMnCr system compared to that of the other Cantor derivatives.  
Figure 3c shows the predicted phase distribution in the FeNi-Mn-Cr ternary diagram using a 
DFT-RF model. The existence of the σ phase is apparent in Cr-rich region, and the predicted 
space for dual SS phases aligns with the observed FeNi/Cr-transition region. Most of the 
predicted SS regions match well with the measurements, except Mn-rich ones where the 
observed BCC region is predicted to be FCC. This might result from the relatively high effective 
cooling rate in magnetron sputtering, allowing for depositing thin films in a metastable state [26-
28]. Similar to the amorphous structure in both FeNi- and Cr-rich regions, the NC-BCC structure 
is likely a metastable deposition product in the Mn-rich region. The driving force for BCC grain 
growth appears to be much lower than the BCC/FCC transformation barrier, leading to the 
existence of BCC phase during in-situ heating in Mn-rich region. This diagram provides a 
sequential phase classification (IM or SS, single or dual, FCC or BCC) according to the 

prediction after correction. The assumptions and threshold setting in the DFT-RF results generate 
a temperature-independent phase formation preference over the composition space.  
The stability of SS phases is determined using DFT calculations by comparing their equilibrium 
energy, and broadly, these calculations agree with in-situ XRD results from 500-700 °C. 
However, due to the omission of vibrational entropy, it often overestimates the  Ttrans, compared 
to experimentally determined values, as suggested by prior work on Fe-Ni alloys [35,36]. 
Therefore, a correction factor is required for more accurate predictions of the Ttrans, and the 
melting point TMP can be used as a normalization factor for samples with various compositions. 
Here, we propose the ratio of Ttrans / TMP to better align the phase transformation tendency 
predicted by DFT to experimental observations for different compositions, where TMP is 
estimated by the rule of mixtures (Figure S8a). A lower factor value indicates a higher likelihood 
of forming either BCC or FCC SS phases. Using this factor, we can observe a rational threshold 
for whether a phase transition occurs. Based on the experimental observations, a value of 75% is 
determined to be suitable for the IM-SS classification, i.e., SS would form for samples with Ttrans 
lower than 75% TMP. Similarly, a factor considering the transformation to either BCC or FCC 
phase is proposed by comparing 𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝐵𝐶𝐶 and 𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝐹𝐶𝐶. A threshold of 90% in the difference between 
𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝐵𝐶𝐶 and 𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝐹𝐶𝐶 is observed for the coexistence of the dual SS phase where 𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝐵𝐶𝐶 and 𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝐹𝐶𝐶 
represent the transition temperatures determined from the DFT-ML models for the BCC and 
FCC transitions, respectively.  
CALPHAD simulations were performed for Fe-Ni-Mn-Cr quaternary systems at 400-700 °C (in 
100°C increments) and 1000 °C [18,37]. The FCC, BCC, and σphase are the major structures 
observed over the composition space. As the temperature increases, the region of σ phase 
decreases, forming stable FCC or BCC SS structures. Figure S10 compares the CALPHAD-RF 
predicted equilibrium phases with the XRD-indexed phases in the 500-700 °C range. The best 
agreement between the CALPHAD-RF model (Figure 3d) and the experimental results occurs at 
700 °C. Similar to the agreement in the Fe-rich region with the DFT-RF model, the CALPHAD-
RF model also successfully predicts the existence of the FCC phase in the same composition 
region. However, the CALPHAD-predicted FCC area is larger than that of the experimental 
results, labeling the Mn-rich region as FCC and the Cr-rich region as dual SS phases, and the 
predicted FCC region still occupies a significantly large compositional space even at a higher 
temperature (1000 °C, Figure S10). In contrast to experimental observations, CALPHAD 
predicts that the σ phase should form in compositions with high Mn concentration. Therefore, 
despite excellent agreement in the FeNi-rich region, there are considerable discrepancies 
between CALPHAD predictions and experimental results in other regions of compositional 
space. 
The distributions of the DFT-RF model predictions in the Ω-δ plot and Δχ-VECmix diagrams are 
shown in Figures 3e and 3f, respectively. Considering the classification between IM and SS 
phases, DFT-RF results show a similar distribution to that of the empirical criteria in Ω-δ plot, 
i.e., SS forms in the whole range, and IM is located in the upper region (𝜎∙𝛺> 24). We note 

that BCC prefers to exist in upper regions while FCC in lower ones in DFT-RF results, with a 
considerable area of overlapping transition. While the empirical relationship between Ω and δ 
does not differentiate the SS types, the Δχ-VECmix plot provides a more discriminating 
classification. Similar to experimental results, the predicted BCC tends to form when VECmix is 
small, and the predicted IM is located in the medium Δχ range. However, a significant 
discrepancy exists in the low VECmix and high Δχ region, i.e., Mn-rich and Cr/Mn-transition 
samples. These are the regions with the largest disagreement between computational and 
experimental results: the DFT-RF model predicts both types to present as FCC phase, but both 
experimental and empirical observations indicate a preference for BCC formation, while the 
CALPHAD-RF prediction labels Cr/Mn-transition samples as dual phase.

points represent the sample and ternary space data, respectively. 
As mentioned, the DFT-RF prediction provides a phase transformation tendency at each 
composition though, the temperature 𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 for the transition determined from DFT calculations 
is not equivalent to the measured temperature of an actual sample. The above discussion 
describes a temperature-independent threshold to better align DTF-RF predictions to the 
experimental observations. However, this method is limited by correction based on observations, 
and the selection of threshold values only provides a temperature-independent phase 
classification. Rather than consider only the thermodynamically stable phase with temperature 
and composition, it may be more insightful to discuss 𝑝𝑛(𝑇) the formation probability of phase 
n. We model the phase transition following the classical logistic sigmoid function as it provides 
(1) clear class labels, (2) a convenient probability of the class, and (3) the ability to model abrupt 
phase transitions [38,39]. We propose to model the probability of the formation of the 
intermetallic phase 𝑝𝐼𝑀(𝑇) with a modified logistic function:  
𝑝𝐼𝑀(𝑇) =
1
1 + 𝑒𝑘(∆𝑇∗−𝑐)  
where ∆𝑇∗= (𝑇−𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝐼𝑀
)/𝑇𝑀𝑃 is the normalized difference in temperatures with 𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝐼𝑀
 being 
the predicted SS-IM transition temperature predicted by DFT, and 𝑐 a correction factor due to 
temperature overestimation. k is a slope parameter, considering ∆𝑇∗values of all points 
𝑘=
10
𝑚𝑎𝑥(∆𝑇∗)−𝑚𝑖𝑛(∆𝑇∗). 
Since the stable phases are either intermetallic or solid solution, the probability of SS formation 
𝑝𝑆𝑆(𝑇) is given by 
𝑝𝑆𝑆(𝑇) = 1 −𝑝𝐼𝑀(𝑇) 
The formation probability 𝑝𝑆𝑆(𝑇)of the SS phases encompasses both single and dual phase SSs 
(Figure S11), i.e., 
𝑝𝑆𝑆(𝑇) = 𝑝𝑆𝑆
𝑆(𝑇) + 𝑝𝑆𝑆
𝐷(𝑇). 
where 𝑝𝑆𝑆
𝑆(𝑇) and 𝑝𝑆𝑆
𝐷(𝑇) represent the probabilities of the single and dual phase SS, 
respectively. For the SS states, we assume that the relative formation of the dual SS state is 
temperature independent and model it as  

𝑝∗=
1
1 + 𝑒𝛾  
where 𝛾=𝑘(
|𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝐵𝐶𝐶−𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝐹𝐶𝐶|
min(𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝐵𝐶𝐶,𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝐹𝐶𝐶) −𝑐∗). The threshold modification values of 𝑐 (0.25) and 𝑐∗ (0.1) are 
set based on the observation in Figure 3c. The temperature-dependent formation probabilities 
are: 
𝑝𝑆𝑆
𝐷(𝑇) = 𝑝∗[1 −𝑝𝐼𝑀(𝑇)] 
𝑝𝑆𝑆
𝑆(𝑇) = (1 −𝑝∗) × 𝑝𝑆𝑆(𝑇) = (1 −𝑝∗)[1 −𝑝𝐼𝑀(𝑇)] 
Thus, the probability of forming BCC or FCC (A or B) phase is: 
𝑝𝐴(𝑇) = 1 −𝑝𝐼𝑀(𝑇) 
 𝑝𝐵(𝑇) = 𝑝𝑆𝑆
𝐷(𝑇) 
for 𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝐴
< 𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝐵
 where 𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝐴
 and 𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
𝐵
 represent the predicted transition temperature of 
phase A and phase B, respectively. 
 
Figure 4a shows the calibrated phase formability of the intermetallic structure at 700 °C. Besides 
Cr-based and Mn-based compositions (triangle corners), IM structure mainly exists at the Cr-rich 
region among the library, manifested as the σ phase in XRD. Figure 4b presents the temperature-
independent 𝑝𝑆𝑆
𝐷 values in the composition space. The FeNi-rich, Mn-rich, and FeNi/Cr-
transition regions also exhibited the tendency to form dual phases, while only FeNi/Cr-transition 
demonstrated the formation of FCC+BCC structure in XRD observations. 
To assess how well models capture experimental behavior, we define the confidence metric 𝜅, 
which considers the combination of both IM/SS and BCC/FCC pairs, i.e., 
𝜅= 1
2 ∗∑𝐴𝑖
𝑆𝑆
𝐼𝑀,𝐵𝐶𝐶
𝐹𝐶𝐶
𝑖
= 1
2 ∗(𝐴𝐼𝑀+ 𝐴𝑆𝑆) = 1
2 𝐴𝐼𝑀+ 1
2 (0.5 ∗𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐶+ 0.5 ∗𝐴𝐹𝐶𝐶) 
, where 𝐴𝑖 = 1 if the experimental observations for both phases of the pair agree with the 
predictions, 0.5 if only one phase agrees, and 0 if neither phase agrees. Thus, a higher value 
indicates a higher correlation of the predictions to the observations. Consider the sample in 
FeNi/Cr-transition region as an example (Figure 4c). The dual phases formed at 500 °C and were 
maintained above 700 °C. In the probability plot, the intersection of IM and BCC curves (~ 
520 °C) indicates a considerable formation of the BCC phase; due to a high probability of dual 
phase, FCC is expected to form immediately after BCC. The good agreement between 
experiment and calculation results in a fully confident value (𝜅= 1) above 520 °C.  

Since all samples present a relatively stable SS structure between 500 and 700 °C, we calculate 
the average 𝜅values of DFT-RF models within this temperature range (Figure 4d). It should be 
noted that the co-existence of IM and SS was not considered when we set 0.5 as the phase 
formability threshold, which is slightly different from the true observations. The 𝜅values of Cr-
rich samples are lower than those of the FeNi-rich ones (~ 1). Despite the robust prediction of the 
non-existence of IM, the juxtaposition of the observed BCC and predicted FCC phases leads to a 
decrease in 𝜅values for Mn-rich samples.  
We also evaluate the CALPHAD-RF results to obtain the average 𝜅 values over three 
temperatures (500, 600, and 700 °C) (Figure 4e). The FeNi-rich samples still exhibit the highest 
𝜅 value, but the experimentally observed BCC phase contradicts the predicted σ and FCC phases, 
resulting in the lowest 𝜅values being located in the Mn-rich region. Therefore, despite 
CALPHAD-RF successfully predicting the structure in the FeNi-rich region, its agreement in 
other compositional regions is relatively low, with an especially considerable mismatch in the σ 
phase region compared to that of the DFT-RF model.

The variability in values across the composition space highlights an opportunity to evaluate and 
refine the computational models in guiding experiments. Rather than relying solely on a fixed, 
sequential sampling approach, future iterations could integrate prior DFT and CALPHAD 
predictions with newly acquired experimental results to progressively update our assessment of 
model reliability. The automated experimental platform enables immediate incorporation of the 
outcomes of each iteration into an active learning framework with a modified acquisition 
function. This closed-loop strategy would prioritize experiments that yield maximum 
information, efficiently reducing uncertainty and effectively minimizing the required 
measurements. This approach has the potential to enhance the correspondence between 
simulations and experimental realities, improving the efficacy of high-throughput exploration in 
complex composition spaces. 
 
Conclusions 
In this study, we systematically investigated the phase stability and transformation pathways of 
the FeNiMnCr HEA system by integrating high-throughput in-situ synchrotron XRD and 
combined computational DFT-RF and CALPHAD-RF methods. Our computational predictions 
revealed unique phase formability trends within the FeNiMnCr composition space, specifically 
highlighting the critical transition from IM to SS phases. Experimental validation via in-situ 
XRD across broad compositional and temperature ranges (room temperature to ~1000 °C) 
confirmed distinct phase transformations, including metastable-to-stable solid-solution 
transitions, as well as variation in FCC and BCC phases. To reconcile the discrepancies between 
predicted and observed transition temperatures, we introduced a modified logistic sigmoid 
function that calibrates predictions to experimental conditions and provides a probabilistic 
description of phase formation. We further proposed a confidence metric that quantifies the 
agreement between models and experiments across temperature and composition. After applying 
the modification to account for the temperature range of phase formation, DFT-RF predictions 
demonstrate better agreement with experimental results than the CALPHAD-RF model does, 
while discrepancies remained in the Mn-rich region. 
 
Method 
DC magnetron co-sputtering was performed to fabricate FeNiMnCr HEA composition-gradient 
library (Figure S2a) with an AJA three-gun deposition system. High-purity 2-inch Cr and Mn 
targets were used in two of the cathodes. The third cathode contained overlapping semi-circular 
high-purity Fe and Ni foils. Deposition on 4-inch Si wafter was done with a pressure of 10 
mTorr. The corresponding parameters are listed in Table S1. The in-situ synchrotron X-ray 

diffraction was performed in the Brockhouse beamline at Canadian Light Source (Figure S2b). 
Wafer samples were cut into small chips (12.5 mm × 16 mm) and arranged on Mo holders in the 
sample trays. KiNEDx Robot was applied to grab one of the samples and move it to the in-situ 
XRD instrument. The incidence X-ray was set as 7.16 keV with a wavelength of 1.7318 Å. The 
actual two-theta range of the collected XRD signal was 25.6° - 64.4°, and the equivalent angle 
covering the same d range in Cu Kα wavelength would be 22.7° - 56.6°.  The average 
temperature ramp rate was 4 °C/s, and the corresponding rate variation of calibrated temperatures 
is shown in Figure S17. The XRD results experienced smoothing, background correcting, and 
peak fitting using Savitzky-Golay filter [40], asymmetric truncated quadratic [41], and Gaussian 
+ Lorentzian model, respectively. Annealing was performed up to 1000 °C within purified He 
with a hot Ti charge. The temperature was determined from cubic spline interpolation of the 
known melting temperatures of reference materials Al, Ag, Au, Sn, and In. XRF measurements 
were performed with a Proto mScanXRF instrument; the composition distributions of elements 
are shown in Figure S3.  
 
The calculation workflow integrated Pymatgen for composition handling and phase diagram 
construction, Matminer for feature generation, and Scikit-learn for machine learning (ML) model 
construction. The energy above the convex hull (eabove hull) for Fe-Ni-Mn-Cr alloys was predicted 
using a hybrid DFT-ML approach. The DFT dataset of formation energies from a previous high-
throughput DFT study was used, with a few additions of intermetallics phases relevant to this 
work. The DFT dataset mainly comprises intermetallics structures and disordered phases 
represented by special quasi-random structures. Based on the DFT results, the most stable 
intermetallic phases on the convex hull can be identified and eabove hull for disordered phases can 
be calculated for the compositions considered in the DFT dataset. The CALPHAD simulation 
was performed using the computation software, PanDatTM [37], for equilibrium phases at 500 - 
700 °C, in which the composition space was mapped in 5 at% increments from 0-100 at% of 
each element [18]. To obtain results for compositions not considered in either DFT or 
CALPHAD datasets, ML models were trained on DFT-calculated formation energies of 
disordered phases and CALPHAD-calculated phase fractions, respectively. Compositional 
features were generated using Matminer, including stoichiometric ratios (e.g., atomic fractions), 
Magpie elemental properties (electronegativity, radii), valence orbital occupancies, and ionic 
characteristics, yielding a 145-dimensional feature vector. After feature correlation analysis with 
a threshold of 0.8 (Figures S14, S15), 21 features were selected for further training. ML models 
(Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gaussian Process) were trained separately for BCC and FCC 
lattices. Random Forest employed 500 trees with max_features=1/3, while XGBoost used 1000 
trees (learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=6). Models were evaluated via 10-fold cross-validation 
(Table S3), and final predictions were made on a quaternary composition grid (Fe-Ni-Mn-Cr, 2 
at% step, Figure S8c) with fixed Fe:Ni (1:1). Transition temperatures were estimated by 𝑇𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠=

Figure S1. High-throughput screening on quaternary space as a function of SS-IM transformation 
temperature. Based on the Random Forest model trained on DFT input of energy above hull, the 
corresponding ordered intermetallic to disordered solid-solution (IM-SS) transformation 
temperatures were predicted over Fe-Ni-Mn-Cr-Co-Al-Si space, highlighting critical phase 
evolution mechanisms in FeNiMnCr system.

Figure S4 shows the detailed phase transformation from 600 °C to 1000 °C. Considering the 
onset of silicide appearance (Figure S4a), the enrichment of Mn leads to a significant decrease in 
formation temperature (< 600 °C). All samples experienced a step-by-step reaction to silicon, 
consequently forming stable transition metal silicide (TM-Si, P213), where Fe, Ni, Mn, Cr 
elements are randomly distributed in the lattice. A simple reaction process occurred in the FeNi-
rich region (Figure S4b): the start of Si influx led to the formation of FeNiSi4; then it 
disappeared, and the stable TM-Si existed at the highest temperature (1000 °C).  Similar reaction 
steps occurred in the FeNi/Cr transition samples (Figure S4c); FeNiSi4 became stable, and CrSi2 
also appeared at 1000 °C. As Cr concentration increased (Figure S4d), the FeNi-rich phases 
disappeared; besides the existence of stable CrSi2 and TM-Si as final products, FCC phase, 
Mn4Si7, and Cr3Si progressively formed and disappeared as intermediate products; the easier 
reaction between Mn and Si resulted in the appearance of Mn4Si7 at lower temperatures (< 
700 °C). In the Mn-rich region (Figure S4e), Mn4Si7 and TM-Si became the final products; 
besides the early Mn-Si reaction, dual BCC and intermetallic FeMn2 phases also formed at 
medium temperatures. The Mn/Cr transition samples (Figure S4f) exhibited a combination of 
reactions in Mn-rich and Cr-rich samples. It should be noted that the FCC phase may also exist 
in Mn-rich and Cr-rich regions; however, the peaks overlapping with Mn-rich BCC and Cr3Si 

phases lead to the difficulty in clearly identifying the FCC phase. The silicide formation 
tendency can also be evaluated using the DFT method (Figure S4), demonstrating the earlier 
formation of Cr3Si and Mn4Si7 and the existence of final TM-Si products.

XRD curves of different samples in the temperature range between 600-1000 °C and

Potential phases of silicide structures were identified through XRD. Their free energies were 
evaluated by considering the ground state energies at 0 K and the ideal configurational entropy: 
𝐺= 𝐻0 𝑘−𝑇∗𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑓
𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑎𝑙. Under this assumption, the free energy change is attributed to the entropic 
contribution. For intermetallics (silicide), their configuration entropy is zero, so the free energy is 
constant with respect to temperature. In contrast, FeNiSi4, as well as the final TM-Si products, 
are partially disordered, with Fe and Ni (Fe, Ni, Mn, and Cr) randomly distributed in the same 
sublattice. Therefore, ideal configurational entropy on the corresponding sublattice is considered. 

In the FeNi-rich sample, FeNiSi4 is more likely to form first and then transform into TM-Si due 
to the considerable free energy decrease of TM-Si at higher temperatures. With more Cr added to 
the system, CrSi2, with relatively high free energy, forms at higher temperatures than FeNiSi4 and 
TM-Si in the FeNi/Cr-transition region. In the Cr-rich sample, metastable Cr3Si and Mn4Si7, with 
significantly low free energy, are the earlier products. The energy difference between the two 
intermetallics (Cr3Si and Mn4Si7) is only 0.006 eV/atom, which is close to DFT accuracy limit, 
especially when considering there could be temperature-induced effects on relative stability. 
With more Mn added to the system, the reaction follows the sequence of silicide with low to high 
free energy, i.e., Mn4Si7 to TM-Si to CrSi2 in the Cr/Mn-transition region; a similar process 
occurs in the Mn-rich sample without the formation of CrSi2.

Figure S9. Comparison of phase predictions using the RF model with input of (a) 7-element and

prediction. Despite the model presenting the FeNi/Cr-transition region with a dual phase of 

FCC+BCC structures, it mistakenly predicts the FeNi-rich region with also dual phase (Figure 
S8a); for the inputs with a larger element space, i.e., more Fe- and Ni-rich data provided in other 
alloy systems, the dual phase region significantly disappears (Figure S8b).
