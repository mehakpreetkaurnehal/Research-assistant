Parameter estimation remains a challenging task across many areas of engineering. Because
data acquisition can often be costly, limited, or prone to inaccuracies (noise, uncertainty) it
is crucial to identify sensor configurations that provide the maximum amount of information
about the unknown parameters, in particular for the case of distributed-parameter systems, where
spatial variations are important. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently
emerged as a powerful machine-learning (ML) tool for parameter estimation, particularly in
cases with sparse or noisy measurements, overcoming some of the limitations of traditional
optimization-based and Bayesian approaches. Despite the widespread use of PINNs for solving
inverse problems, relatively little attention has been given to how their performance depends on
sensor placement. This study addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive PINN-based
framework that simultaneously tackles optimal sensor placement and parameter estimation. Our
approach involves training a PINN model in which the parameters of interest are included
as additional inputs. This enables the efficient computation of sensitivity functions through
automatic differentiation, which are then used to determine optimal sensor locations exploiting
the D-optimality criterion. The framework is validated on two illustrative distributed-parameter
reaction-diffusion-advection problems of increasing complexity. The results demonstrate that our
PINNs-based methodology consistently achieves higher accuracy compared to parameter values
estimated from intuitively or randomly selected sensor positions.

1. Introduction
Distributed-parameter systems, based on partial differential equations (PDEs), typically describing spatiotemporal
variations, represent a wide range of physical systems and phenomena in science and engineering. These PDE-based
models typically involve multiple unknown parameters, often corresponding to physical properties of the system, whose
accurate identification from available data is essential for reliable prediction and effective system design. In general, the
accuracy of parameter estimation improves as more data is collected. Nevertheless, acquiring large datasets is often
expensive or impractical. This motivates the development of systematic methods for selecting sensor locations that
maximize the information gained about the unknown parameters under constraints on the number of sensors.
Most research on Optimal Sensor Placement has focused on state estimation, while comparatively fewer studies
have addressed parameter estimation directly (Alaña and Theodoropoulos, 2011, 2012). Existing approaches typically
rely on scalar measures derived from the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), which captures the sensitivity of observable
quantities with respect to parameters. For example, the modified E-criterion (Mehra, 1974; Walter and Pronzato, 1990;
Nahor et al., 2003) minimizes the ratio of the largest to the smallest eigenvalue of the FIM, while Heredia-Zavoni and
Esteva (1998) proposed minimizing the expected Bayesian loss involving the trace of the inverse FIM. The widely used
D-optimality criterion (Qureshi et al., 1980; Vande Wouwer et al., 2000) maximizes the determinant of the FIM (or

A Physics Informed Machine Learning Framework for Optimal Sensor Placement and Parameter Estimation
the Gram determinant), and a closely related approach minimizes the information entropy (Papadimitriou et al., 2000),
reflecting the uncertainty of the parameter under a given sensor configuration.
In large-scale distributed systems, parameter estimation can be facilitated by combining model reduction with
optimal sensor placement. In Alonso et al. (2004), the proposed workflow is to construct a Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (POD) reduced-order model that captures the dominant spatio-temporal dynamics and then determine
measurement locations by optimizing an observability-based criterion on this reduced model. Alaña and Theodor-
opoulos (2011) further streamline this process by proposing sensor placement directly at the extrema of the dominant
POD modes, an approach that circumvents costly sensitivity-matrix computations while still providing near-optimal
parameter estimation performance.
Once sensor locations are defined, the next step is parameter estimation. Optimization-based methods, such as
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) (Myung, 2003), remain the most established, with Least Squares as the most
common implementation under the assumption of Gaussian measurement noise (Biegler et al., 1986; Englezos and
Kalogerakis, 2000). While effective, these methods typically require repeated model evaluations, resulting in high
computational cost, particularly when gradients with respect to parameters must also be computed. Moreover, the
accuracy of estimated parameters may degrade under sparse or noisy data (Kravaris et al., 2013). Bayesian methods
offer an alternative by incorporating prior information and providing full uncertainty quantification through posterior
distributions (Coleman and Block, 2006; Hermanto et al., 2008; Kalyanaraman et al., 2015). Nevertheless, Bayesian
inference often relies on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling (Hastings, 1970), which requires extensive
forward model evaluations and can be sensitive to prior selection in data-limited settings (Lenk and Orme, 2009).
Recent advances in machine learning have substantially enhanced the field of parameter estimation by introducing
data-driven methodologies capable of capturing complex relationships between model parameters and observed
data. Traditional statistical approaches, such as maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian inference, have been
extended through modern techniques, such as variational inference (Blei et al., 2017) and neural density estimation
(Papamakarios et al., 2021) that enable efficient and accurate parameter recovery, even in complex or high-dimensional
settings. Furthermore, deep neural architectures, coupled with gradient-based optimization algorithms, including
stochastic gradient descent and its adaptive variants (Bottou, 2010), facilitate scalable and robust inference across
a wide range of applications.
Hybrid modeling frameworks that integrate data with first-principles formulations have merged as powerful tools
for scientific computing. Among these, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) (Raissi et al., 2019) exploit the
expressivity of deep neural networks (Hornik et al., 1989) while embedding governing PDEs as soft constraints. PINNs
have proven particularly useful in scenarios where traditional solvers face challenges: complex geometries (since PINNs
are mesh-free), high-dimensional problems (Hu et al., 2024). and systems with incomplete physics that require data-
driven enhancement (Raissi et al., 2020). Importantly, PINNs enable parameter estimation by directly incorporating
unknown parameters into the training process, making them robust even under sparse or noisy observations, which is
of particular relevance to this work.
Numerous studies have applied PINNs to inverse problems in chemical engineering and related fields. Examples
include the estimation of thermal properties in additive manufacturing (Liao et al., 2023), thermal diffusivity in two-
phase flows (Cai et al., 2021), kinetic parameters in catalytic reactors (Ngo and Lim, 2021; Huang et al., 2025), and
transport coefficients in porous media (Berardi et al., 2025). PINNs have also been used in fluid mechanics, such as
inferring density fields in high-speed flows (Mao et al., 2020) and thrombus properties in arterial flows (Yin et al.,
2021).
Despite these successes, most studies assume dense observations across the spatial domain, often generated from
numerical simulations, overlooking the constraints of real-world sensor settings. For instance, Ngo and Lim (2021)
observed that parameter estimation accuracy strongly depends on the spatial region from which data is collected,
but this conclusion was based on manual experimentation rather than systematic sensor placement strategies. The
integration of optimal sensor placement with PINNs remains relatively unexplored. A few attempts have been made:
Forootani et al. (2024) proposed a greedy sampling approach (GS-PINN), which selects informative samples via
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and the Discrete Empirical Interpolation (DEIM) method (Chaturantabut
and Sorensen, 2010), but their approach requires access to full spatio-temporal data and selects time-varying sensor
positions, limiting practical use. In Chang et al. (2025), they introduce a sensitivity-based sampling method (SBS) that
adapts sensor placement based on gradients of the PINN loss with respect to collocation points. However, this method
was designed for state reconstruction problems in process control, not parameter estimation, as it does not account for
sensitivities with respect to the parameters.

A Physics Informed Machine Learning Framework for Optimal Sensor Placement and Parameter Estimation
In this work, we address this gap by proposing a PINN framework that integrates D-optimal sensor placement
directly into the parameter estimation process. Our approach relies on two complementary neural network models.
The first model incorporates the parameters of interest as inputs, enabling the computation of sensitivity functions via
automatic differentiation (AD). These sensitivities are used to select optimal sensor locations under the D-optimality
criterion. The second, is a standard PINN model trained on data obtained from these optimal locations to perform
parameter estimation and state reconstruction.
We demonstrate our method on two illustrative case studies involving reaction-diffusion-advection systems of
increased complexity: a one-dimensional steady-state problem, and a two-dimensional transient problem. In each case,
the goal is to estimate important dimensionless parameters for the system such as the Péclet number and Damköhler
number and to compare their accuracy against estimations made from sub-optimal sensor locations.
The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents the formulation of our method, including sensor selection
and PINN training. Section 3 describes the case studies and results. Finally, Section 4 discusses the main conclusions
and the relevant future directions.
2. Methods
2.1. Selection of Optimal Sensor Location for Parameter Estimation
In this work, we adopt the D-optimality criterion, widely used for sensor placement due to its geometric inter-
pretability and invariance to parameter rescaling (Franceschini and Macchietto, 2008; Bard, 1974). For implementation,
we follow the method of Vande Wouwer et al. (2000), chosen for its simplicity. Alternative optimality criteria can also
be applied as discussed in (Alaña and Theodoropoulos, 2011).
Consider a system with states 𝐮(𝐱, 𝑡) described by the governing PDE:
𝜕𝐮
𝜕𝑡+ [𝐮; 𝜆] = 0,
𝐱∈Ω,
𝑡≥0,
(1)
subject to the following initial and boundary conditions:
𝐮(0, 𝐱) = 𝐠(𝐱),
𝐱∈Ω,
(2)
[𝐮] = 0,
𝐱∈𝜕Ω,
𝑡≥0,
(3)
where [⋅] is a differential operator, and [⋅] a boundary operator, 𝜆= [𝜆1, … , 𝜆𝑃
] are the 𝑝unknown parameters,
and Ω the spatial domain.
For state measurements at 𝑁sensor locations 𝐱1, … , 𝐱𝑁we define sensitivity functions as:
𝑠𝜆𝑗(𝐱𝑖, 𝑡) = 𝜕𝐮
𝜕𝜆𝑗
(𝐱𝑖, 𝑡), 𝑖= 1, … , 𝑁, 𝑗= 1, … , 𝑃,
(4)
and collect them into a vector 𝑀:
𝑀(𝑥1, … , 𝑥𝑁, 𝑡) = [𝑠𝜆1(𝐱1, 𝑡) … 𝑠𝜆𝑃(𝐱1, 𝑡) … 𝑠𝜆1(𝐱𝑁, 𝑡) … 𝑠𝜆𝑃(𝐱𝑁, 𝑡)]𝑇.
(5)
The Fisher Information Matrix, 𝐹, is then:
𝐹(𝐱1, … , 𝐱𝑁) = ∫
𝑇
0
𝑀(𝑥1, … , 𝑥𝑁, 𝑡)𝑀𝑇(𝑥1, … , 𝑥𝑁, 𝑡) 𝑑𝑡,
(6)
where [0, 𝑇] is the observation horizon. The matrix 𝐹is positive semi-definite with its diagonal entries quantifying
sensor sensitivity to parameters, while its off-diagonal entries capture correlations between the corresponding
parameters.
The optimal sensor locations 𝐱∗

𝑁= arg max
𝐱1,…,𝐱𝑁det [𝐹(𝐱1, … , 𝐱𝑁)] .
(7)
Maximizing det(𝐹) encourages both large sensitivities (via diagonal dominance) and independence (via small
off-diagonal terms).
For steady-state problems the FIM reduces to:
𝐹(𝐱1, … , 𝐱𝑁) = 𝑀(𝑥1, … , 𝑥𝑁, 𝑡)𝑀𝑇(𝑥1, … , 𝑥𝑁, 𝑡),
(8)
which is rank-1 with zero determinant, rendering D-optimality unusable. For these cases, we instead select optimal
sensor locations by maximizing the FIM trace:
𝐱∗
1, … , 𝐱∗
𝑁= arg max
𝐱1,…,𝐱𝑁tr [𝐹(𝐱1, … , 𝐱𝑁)] .
(9)
Our PINN framework as well as the calculation of sensitivities using PINNs is discussed next.
2.2. Physics Informed Neural Networks: General Framework
PINNs are fully connected neural networks that incorporate PDE constraints into their loss function (Wang et al.
(2023)). They address two problem types:
(a) Forward Problems: approximating PDE solutions with known parameters and boundary/initial conditions,
without experimental data.
(b) Inverse Problems: estimating unknown parameters from experimental data, while simultaneously approximating
the PDE solution.
For the forward problem, the system state 𝐮(𝑡, 𝐱) governed by Eqs. (1)–(3) is approximated by a neural network
̂𝐮(𝑡, 𝐱, 𝜃), where 𝜃denotes trainable weights and biases. Training minimizes a composite loss function, :
(𝜃) = 𝑓(𝜃) + 𝑖𝑐(𝜃) + 𝑏𝑐(𝜃),
(10)
with terms enforcing PDE residuals (𝑓), initial conditions (𝑖𝑐), and boundary conditions (𝑏𝑐). Automatic
differentiation computes derivatives of the system state required for residual evaluation (PDE and boundary conditions
residuals).
For inverse problems, observational data {𝐮𝑖

(11)
leading to the total loss function:
(𝜃) = 𝑖𝑐(𝜃) + 𝑏𝑐(𝜃) + 𝑓(𝜃) + 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎(𝜃).
(12)
In this case, PINNs are optimized with respect to both 𝜽and unknown parameters 𝝀.

Figure 1: Schematic representation of the methodology for computing sensitivity derivatives using PINNs. The neural
network admits as input the spatio-temporal coordinates (𝐱, 𝑡) along with the parameters of interest, 𝜆. The loss function
to be minimized is constructed from the system residuals (PDE and boundary/initial conditions) and their derivatives
with respect to the parameters, 𝜆.
2.3. Sensitivity functions with PINNs
As described in Section 2.1, optimal sensor placement requires sensitivity functions (Eq. (4)). Following Hanna
et al. (2024), the PINN input is extended to include both spatio-temporal coordinates and parameters 𝜆, enabling
AD-based computation of 𝜕̂𝐮∕𝜕𝜆𝑗. Additional loss terms enforce accurate parameter sensitivities calculation:
(𝜃) = 𝑖𝑐(𝜃) + 𝑏𝑐(𝜃) + 𝑓(𝜃) + 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠,𝑖𝑐(𝜃) + 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠,𝑏𝑐(𝜃) + 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠,𝑓(𝜃),

Each 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠,⋅term penalizes derivatives of residuals with respect to 𝜆.
Training is performed with prior parameter estimates, 𝜆𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟. The resulting sensitivity functions are then used
to construct the FIM and determine optimal sensor locations. Here we assume that their qualitative structure (e.g.,
locations of maxima) remains the same when evaluated at 𝜆𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟compared to the true 𝜆. When the computed optima
differ substantially, we use an iterative approach. Fig. 1 illustrates the process.
Once sensor placement is decided, state data are collected from the corresponding locations, and the inverse
problem is solved using PINNs. To accelerate training, we apply transfer learning (Zhuang et al., 2021): the inverse
PINN is initialized from a pretrained forward PINN at prior parameter values, 𝜆𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑟. A lightweight fine-tuning strategy
is adopted here (Goswami et al., 2020), which retrains only the last hidden layers while freezing the earlier ones,
reducing both the number of epochs and the per-iteration cost.
Finally, to improve PINN training efficiency and stability we incorporate techniques including:

• Dynamic loss weighting: Following Li and Feng (2022), loss weights 𝑤𝑘multiplying each loss term in the loss
function are adaptively updated to balance gradients across different terms, preventing dominance by any single
component (see e.g., Eq. (18) and Eq. (31) below).
• Residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR-D): Collocation points are adaptively chosen according to the PDE
residual (Wu et al., 2023), focusing training on regions with higher errors. We extend this strategy to boundary
and initial condition sampling (collocation) points as well.
• Non-dimensionalization: PDEs are solved in dimensionless form, preventing vanishing/exploding gradients
and ensuring balanced loss contributions across variables (Wang et al., 2023).
3. Case Studies
This section presents two illustrative examples that demonstate our PINNs-based methodology and also showcase
how the optimal sensor placement criterion enhances parameter inference accuracy. All PINN models are implemented
in Python using the PyTorch® library (Paszke et al., 2019) and trained on an NVIDIA® RTX A4000 GPU computer.
3.1. 1D Steady State Reaction–Advection–Diffusion equation
3.1.1. Problem Set-Up
The first simpler example considers a steady state, one-dimensional reaction-advection-diffusion equation, which
in dimensionless form is given by the following PDE and boundary conditions:
𝑃𝑒𝑑𝑐
𝑑𝑥= 𝑑2𝑐
𝑑𝑥2 −𝐷𝑎𝑐2, 𝑥∈[0, 10] ,
𝑐(0) = 1,
𝑑𝑐
𝑑𝑥
||||𝑥=𝐿
= 0,
(17)
where 𝑃𝑒and 𝐷𝑎denote the Péclet number and the Damköhler number, respectively. In this example, 𝐷𝑎is fixed
(𝐷𝑎= 1.0), and the goal is to estimate the unknown value of 𝑃𝑒with a single, optimally placed sensor.
3.1.2. PINN Framework
To compute sensitivities for the FIM construction, we employ a Sensitivity PINN model with two inputs (𝑥and
𝑃𝑒), four hidden layers of 30 neurons each, and hyperbolic tangent activation. This network structure is chosen to
balance computational efficiency with accuracy. The loss function is
(𝜃) = 𝑤𝑓𝑓(𝜃) + 𝑤𝑏𝑐1𝑏𝑐1(𝜃) + 𝑤𝑏𝑐2𝑏𝑐2(𝜃) + 𝑤𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠
(𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠,𝑓(𝜃) + 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠,𝑏𝑐1(𝜃) + 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠,𝑏𝑐2(𝜃)) ,
(18)
where 𝑓(𝜃), 𝑏𝑐1(𝜃), 𝑏𝑐2(𝜃) correspond to the PDE and boundary condition residuals. The terms 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠,𝑓(𝜃),
𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠,𝑏𝑐1(𝜃) and 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠,𝑏𝑐2(𝜃) represent the corresponding derivatives with respect to 𝑃𝑒. Analytical expressions are
provided in Section I of the Supplementary Material. We sample 800 collocation points on an equispaced grid over the
spatial domain providing sufficient resolution for our PINN model. The loss weights are dynamically updated following
the gradient ascent scheme of Li and Feng (2022). Training is performed with the Adam optimizer (10−3 learning rate)
for 2500 epochs. Since the true value of 𝑃𝑒is to be estimated (unknown), the model is initialized with an a priori
estimate, 𝑃𝑒= 0.1. As noted in Section 2.3, we assume that the maxima of the Gram determinant (or the FIM trace in
this example) are approximately invariant to whether they are computed at the estimated or true parameter values. This
is equivalent to having a "reasonable" prior estimate. An iterative procedure can be employed if the computed optima
vary significantly. For a single-sensor placement problem, the FIM trace reduces to the squared sensitivity of 𝑐with
respect to 𝑃𝑒.
𝑡𝑟[𝐹(𝑥)] =
[ 𝜕𝑐
𝜕𝑃𝑒(𝑥)
]2
, 𝑥∈[0, 10] .
(19)
Fig. 2 shows the FIM trace obtained from the PINN alongside the one obtained by numerically soving the PDE
(equation 17) The results confirm that PINNs accurately compute sensitivity derivatives via automatic differentiation.
Here, it is easy to locate graphically the trace maximum at 𝑥∗= 1.81.

Consequently, pseudo-experimental data are generated numerically using the true value of 𝑃𝑒= 1.0 at two
locations: the optimal location 𝑥∗= 1.81, and a suboptimal point at the outlet, 𝑥∗= 10.0, which is an intuitive
choice for placing the sensor. The inference PINN has the same architecture but accepts only 𝑥as input, with 𝑃𝑒
treated as a trainable parameter. The loss function now reads:
(𝜃) = 𝑤𝑓𝑓(𝜃) + 𝑤𝑏𝑐1𝑏𝑐1(𝜃) + 𝑤𝑏𝑐2𝑏𝑐2(𝜃) + 𝑤𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎(𝜃),

(21)
Since a single sensor is used, 𝑁𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎= 1. The model is trained with the Adam optimizer for 5000 iterations. The
hyperparameters for the Sensitivity and Inference PINNs applied to the 1D steady-state reaction-advection-diffusion
equation are summarized in Table 1.
Fig. 3 shows the inferred 𝑃𝑒during training for data from the optimal and outlet locations. The results highlight
the crucial role of sensor placement: the PINN converges closer to the true 𝑃𝑒, when data are taken at the optimal
location. At the outlet, the parameter fails to converge for the number of epochs used. Final estimates and relative
errors are listed in Table 2.
After identifying the parameter, we recompute the optimal sensor location using the true 𝑃𝑒. As shown in Fig. 4, the
maximum shifts slightly to 𝑥∗= 2.32, very close to the original 𝑥∗= 1.81 supporting the assumption that sensitivity
maxima remain nearly invariant when evaluated with initial parameter estimates.
3.2. 2D Transient Reaction–Advection–Diffusion, Flow Around a Fixed Obstacle
The 1D example demonstrates how our PINN-based methodology guides sensor placement and enables accurate
estimation of a single parameter. To further test the robustness of the framework, we now consider a more complex
2D system that combines nonlinear reaction, advection and diffusion in the presence of an obstacle. This example
introduces additional challenges: heterogeneity due to flow recirculation, transient behavior, as well as the simultaneous
inference of two parameters.

In particular, we address the simultaneous estimation of the dimensionless parameters 𝑃𝑒and 𝐷𝑎in a two-
dimensional, time-dependent reaction-advection-diffusion system. A reactive species is transported by a steady flow
past a fixed cylindrical obstacle.
3.2.1. Problem Set-Up
We consider a 2D rectangular channel of dimensions 𝐿× 𝐻(𝐿= 0.24 m and 𝐻= 0.14 m), with flow from left to
right bounded by impermeable walls at the top and bottom. A fixed cylindrical obstacle of radius 𝑅= 0.01 m is placed
inside the channel perpendicular to the flow direction, at {𝑥0, 𝑦0
} = {0.09, 0.07} m. The fluid is incompressible,
Newtonian, and the flow is considered to be at steady-state. Its velocity, 𝐯, and pressure, 𝑝, fields satisfy the Navier-
Stokes equations (neglecting gravity):
𝜌
(𝜕𝐯
𝜕𝑡+ 𝐯⋅∇𝐯
)
= −∇𝑝+ 𝜇∇2𝐯,
(22)
subject to the incompressibility constraint:
∇⋅𝐯= 0.
(23)
where 𝜌, 𝜇denote the density and dynamic viscosity, respectively.
At the inlet, a parabolic velocity profile is imposed for the horizontal component of velocity, 𝑣𝑥:
𝑣𝑥(0, 𝑦) = 6𝑈
[( 𝑦

)
−
( 𝑦

.
(24)
with no-slip conditions at the walls (including the obstacle surface) and zero pressure at the outlet. The fluid properties
are set to 𝜌= 1000 [𝑘𝑔∕𝑚3], 𝜇= 0.001 [𝑃𝑎⋅𝑠] and average inlet velocity 𝑈= 0.00125 [𝑚∕𝑠].
Given the steady flow 𝐯, the concentration 𝑐(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) of a reactive species evolves according to:

𝜕𝑡+ 𝐯⋅∇𝑐= 𝐷∇2𝑐−𝑘𝑐2, (𝑥, 𝑦) ∈[0, 𝐿] × [0, 𝐻], 𝑡> 0,
(25)
where 𝐷is the diffusion coefficient and 𝑘the reaction rate constant. The initial condition is:
𝑐(𝑥, 𝑦, 0) = 0, (𝑥, 𝑦) ∈(0, 𝐿] × [0, 𝐻].
(26)
The inlet concentration profile is set to change linearly with 𝑦:
𝑐(0, 𝑦, 𝑡) = 𝑦

Zero-flux boundary conditions are applied at the impenetrable walls and the (long) outlet. A schematic of the setup
is shown in Fig. 5.
By selecting as characteristic scales, 𝐿, 𝑈, and 𝑐0 = 1 kg/m3, we derive the following dimensionless variables:
̃𝑥= 𝑥
𝐿, ̃𝑦= 𝑦
𝐿, ̃𝐯= 𝐯

.
Typically, time is scaled using
̃𝑡= 𝑡𝐷
𝐿2 .
However, in this problem, the diffusion coefficient 𝐷is unknown and will be determined implicitly through the
dimensionless parameters. Therefore, it cannot serve as the basis for non-dimensionalizing time. Instead, we define

a characteristic time scale, 𝜏, chosen to be of the same order of magnitude as 𝐿2∕𝐷0, where 𝐷0 is an initial estimate
of the diffusion coefficient. Numerical tests show that setting 𝜏= 4000 s yields good results. The dimensionless time
variable is therefore defined as:
̃𝑡= 𝑡
𝜏.
Thus, in dimensionless form, the governing equations are:

3.2.2. PINN Set-Up
Following the approach of Laubscher (2021), we construct and train separate PINN models: one for the fluid flow
PDEs (Navier-Stokes, Eqs. (28) and (29)) and another for the species transport PDE (Eq. (30)). Because of the one-way
coupling (fluid flow influences mass transport but not vice versa for a dilute system) and since no flow-field parameter
inference is required, we first train the fluid flow PINN using the fixed parameters and boundary conditions described
earlier. Its output is then used to compute the residual of Eq. (30), which in turn guides the training of two distinct
mass transport PINNs: one for computing sensitivity derivatives and another for parameter estimation.
Fluid Flow PINN
The fluid flow PINN admits two inputs, 𝑥and 𝑦, and produces: ̂𝐯, and ̂𝑝. The ̂ symbol is used to denote the PINN
approximation. The architecture is a fully connected neural network with 8 hidden layers of 60 neurons each, using
hyperbolic tangent activation functions. The loss function minimized during training is:
(𝜃) = 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑛(𝜃) + 𝑤𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝜃) + 𝑤𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑢𝑝𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑢𝑝(𝜃) + 𝑤𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑙𝑜𝑤(𝜃)
+ 𝑤𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑡.𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑡.(𝜃) + 𝑤𝑛𝑠𝑛𝑠(𝜃) + 𝑤𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡.𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡.(𝜃),
(31)
where 𝑛𝑠(𝜃) and 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡.(𝜃) correspond to the residuals of Eqs. (28) and (29), and 𝑖𝑛(𝜃), 𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝜃), 𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑢𝑝(𝜃), 𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑙𝑜𝑤,
and 𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑡. correspond to the inlet, outlet and wall boundary condition residuals, respectively. Analytical expressions
for each loss term are provided in Section II.1 of the Supplementary Material. The PINN model is trained for 35,000
iterations with the Adam optimizer, followed by 2,000 iterations with L-BFGS for improved accuracy. We also
employ RAR-D (adaptive collocation point sampling) and an adaptive weight strategy (see Section 2.3). Complete
hyperparameter settings are listed in Table 3. Training requires approximately 95 minutes. The magnitude of the
predicted flow field, |̂𝐯| =
√
̂𝑣2
𝑥+ ̂𝑣2
𝑦, is visualized and compared with the corresponding numerical solution in Fig. 6
showing the high accuracy of the fluid flow PINN model.
Mass-Transport Sensitivity PINN
We next construct a PINN model to compute the sensitivity of species concentration with respect to the
dimensionless parameters 𝑃𝑒and 𝐷𝑎. This model admits five inputs: 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡, 𝑃𝑒, and 𝐷𝑎, and outputs ̂𝑐. Its architecture
consists of 5 hidden layers with 100 neurons each and tanh activations. The loss function is:

𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑡(𝜃) correspond to boundary condition residuals for the species concentration at the inlet, outlet and walls of the
channel. The sensitivity terms sens,𝑃𝑒, sens,𝐷𝑎are sums of the derivatives of all residuals with respect to 𝑃𝑒and
𝐷𝑎, respectively. Details are given in Section II.2 of the Supplementary Material; full training parameters are listed
in Table 3. Since 𝑃𝑒and 𝐷𝑎are initially unknown, this PINN model is trained using initial estimates (here, we use
𝑃𝑒= 7.0 and 𝐷𝑎= 18.0). As discussed in Section 2.3, we assume that the maxima locations of the Gram determinant
remain nearly unchanged when computed with these estimates instead of true values. Training requires approximately
270 minutes.
Once trained, the model provides sensitivity functions 𝑠𝑃𝑒(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) =
𝜕̂𝑐
𝜕𝑃𝑒(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) and 𝑠𝐷𝑎(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡) =
𝜕̂𝑐
𝜕𝐷𝑎(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡)
computed via automatic differentiation. These functions are used to assemble the FIM (Eqs. (5) and (6)), and evaluate
its determinant for sensor placement. For a single sensor, the Gram determinant depends only on (𝑥1, 𝑦1), and its spatial
distribution is illustrated in Fig. 7.
When multiple sensors are considered, the optimization of the Gram determinant becomes multidimensional. To
address this, we employ the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) (Hansen, 2016), a derivative-
free algorithm well suited for high-dimensional, non-convex, and nonlinear problems (Python package 𝑝𝑦𝑐𝑚𝑎(Hansen
et al., 2019)). We first examine the case of three optimal sensor locations and compare the inference results against
a configuration of three intuitively placed sensors around the obstacle (see Fig. 8). Pseudo-experimental data are
generated by computational experiments using the finite element based commercial software COMSOL ® setting
𝑃𝑒= 12.0 and 𝐷𝑎= 22.0 (target values to be inferred by our PINN-based framework). Virtual sensors record species
concentration every 3 seconds.

Mass-Transport PINN for Parameter Estimation
Here, we train a PINN to infer the unknown parameters. This neural network has the same architecture as the
sensitivity PINN, but with only spatio-temporal inputs (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑡). Its loss function excludes the sensitivity terms (sens,𝑃𝑒
and sens,𝐷𝑎) and instead incorporates a data loss term:
𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎(𝜃) =
1
𝑁𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎
𝑁𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎
∑
𝑖=1
|||̂𝑐(𝑥𝑖
𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎, 𝑦𝑖
𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎, 𝑡𝑖
𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎) −𝑐𝑖
𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎
|||
2 .
(33)
For computational efficiency, we first pre-train this network on the forward problem with initial parameter estimates,
then reuse this state for parameter estimation. During fine-tuning, the weights and biases of the first three layers
are frozen (see Section 2.3). The dynamic weight strategy is disabled, and to emphasize observational data we set
𝑤𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎= 100 (weight of data loss term), while keeping all other weights equal to 1. Further training details are provided
in Table 3.
The inference results for the three-sensor configurations are shown in Fig. 9. Both parameters are estimated with
higher accuracy when using optimally placed sensors. In addition, the three optimally placed sensors provide sufficient
information for the PINN to reconstruct the concentration field, as illustrated in Fig. 10.
To study the effect of the number of sensors, we repeat the procedure for 1, 2 and 5 sensors, each time optimizing
sensor placement using CMA-ES and comparing the results with intuitive arrangements. For completeness, we show
the locations of optimally placed sensors and the intuitively selected arrangements for 1,2,3 and 5 sensors in Fig. 11.
Table 4 summarizes the inferred parameter values, showing that optimally placed sensors consistently yield more
accurate estimates. Notably, adding more intuitively placed sensors does not necessarily improve performance, while
accuracy increases monotonically with the number of optimally chosen sensors.
We further tested robustness to noise adding Gaussian noise to the COMSOL-generated pseudo-experimental
concentration data. Each measurement was drawn from:
̃𝑐𝑖
𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎∼(𝑐𝑖
𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎, (0.1𝑐𝑖
𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎)2).
(34)
To account for the noisy data, we repeated the parameter estimation training five times for each configuration. Fig. 12
depicts results for the three-sensor case, showing mean trajectories and standard deviations. Optimal sensors again
led to more accurate averages, particularly for 𝐷𝑎, which corresponds to the nonlinear term of Eq. (30). The same
trends hold for the 1-, 2-, and 5-sensor cases (Table 5). Fig. 13 compares the PINN solution (fitted to noisy data from
3 optimal sensors) with the FEM solution at the true parameters. One can observe that the PINN predictions are in
close agreement with the sensor data in terms of overall trends. Each estimation experiment required approximately
100 minutes of training.
4. Conclusions
In this work, we develop a novel ML-based methodology for optimal sensor placement in large-scale distributed
parameter systems for efficient parameter estimation. We integrate the D-optimal criterion for sensor placement into the
PINN framework, with the goal of leveraging PINNs’ parameter estimation capabilities using minimal observational

data. Our approach first determines optimal sensor locations based on an a priori estimate for the parameters of interest,
and then identifies these parameters using data collected from those locations.
To solve the optimal sensor placement problem, we train a PINN that takes as input both the parameters of
interest and the spatio-temporal coordinates. This design enables the computation of sensitivity functions via automatic
differentiation, which are then used to select the optimal sensor positions. For parameter inference, we employ a
standard PINN architecture trained on data sampled from either optimally placed or intuitively chosen virtual sensors
generated from numerical solutions.
We evaluate the framework on two illustrative case studies: A 1D steady-state and a 2D transient reaction-diffusion-
advection problem. In the 1D case, we estimate the Péclet number using a single sensor. Placement at the optimal
location yields a relative error of only 0.20%, whereas placement at the outlet produces a substantially larger error of
84.7%, underscoring the importance of optimal sensor positioning. In the 2D transient case, we jointly estimate the
Péclet and Damköhler numbers using sensor configurations of 1, 2, 3, and 5 sensors. With noiseless data, optimal sensor
placements consistently provide more accurate estimates, and accuracy improves as the number of sensors increases.
Introducing measurement noise preserved these trends.
Training a PINN to compute sensitivity functions is computationally intensive at the outset (≈270 minutes), owing
to the additional loss terms requiring derivatives of all residuals with respect to all parameters of interest. However,
once trained, transfer learning enables rapid re-training, offering substantial flexibility. This allows the framework to
adapt efficiently to changes in boundary or initial conditions, modifications to system geometry, or variations in the
underlying physics (e.g., altered reaction kinetics), without restarting training from scratch. Moreover, since PINNs
are mesh-less, sensitivity functions can be computed at any spatio-temporal location.
Overall, our findings demonstrate that PINNs can be effectively used to compute sensitivity functions for optimal
sensor placement in parameter estimation. Data collected at these locations significantly improve estimation accuracy,
even under measurement noise. Beyond the benchmark problems considered here, the framework can be extended
to more complex systems with multiple unknown parameters or partially defined models (e.g., unknown kinetics in
plasma reactors), where data acquisition is costly or limited.
