Figure 1. IDEAL-M3D is the first instance-based active learning method for monocular 3D detection. Left: While previous active learning
approaches select entire images for labeling, we identify the most informative object instances (difference is highlighted in rounded boxes).
Right: Our approach achieves full supervised performance using only 50-60% of the labeled boxes, significantly outperforming existing
active learning methods across the majority of object categories (KITTI [12] validation set, AP 0.7
3D|R40Mod.).
Abstract
Monocular 3D detection relies on just a single camera
and is therefore easy to deploy. Yet, achieving reliable 3D
understanding from monocular images requires substantial
annotation, and 3D labels are especially costly. To maximize
performance under constrained labeling budgets, it is essen-
tial to prioritize annotating samples expected to deliver the
largest performance gains. This prioritization is the focus
of active learning. Curiously, we observed two significant
limitations in active learning algorithms for 3D monocular
object detection. First, previous approaches select entire
images, which is inefficient, as non-informative instances
contained in the same image also need to be labeled. Sec-
ondly, existing methods rely on uncertainty-based selection,
which in monocular 3D object detection creates a bias to-
ward depth ambiguity. Consequently, distant objects are
selected, while nearby objects are overlooked.
To address these limitations, we propose IDEAL-M3D, the
first instance-level pipeline for monocular 3D detection. For
the first time, we demonstrate that an explicitly diverse, fast-
to-train ensemble improves diversity-driven active learning
for monocular 3D. We induce diversity with heterogeneous
backbones and task-agnostic features, loss weight pertur-
bation, and time-dependent bagging. IDEAL-M3D shows

superior performance and significant resource savings: with
just 60% of the annotations, we achieve similar or better
AP3D on KITTI validation and test set results compared to
training the same detector on the whole dataset.
1. Introduction
3D object detection estimates 3D bounding boxes of ob-
jects visible in 2D images by predicting their position, orien-
tation, and dimensions. Identifying objects and their geomet-
rical properties is a fundamental step toward understanding
the environment, and with the progress in the autonomous
driving industry [5,7], it has gained significant traction. The
monocular setting is particularly compelling, since relying
on a single RGB camera is flexible, cheap, and simple to set
up. Although estimating 3D properties such as depth from
a monocular view is theoretically impossible, as discussed
in [21,24,34,42,57], strong data priors can address most
of these ambiguities in practice. This leads to reliable and
practically useful predictions [15].
As a consequence, annotated data has become a pivotal
element in fostering research in the field, and the research
community has put tremendous effort into curating large-
scale datasets [22,51,60,73]. However, 3D data annotations
are labor-intensive, costly, and difficult to scale. To limit
such effort, Active Learning (AL) offers a compelling alterna-
1
arXiv:2511.19301v1  [cs.CV]  24 Nov 2025

tive by identifying the most informative unlabeled samples
to annotate. Such selection reduces the redundant annota-
tions [22,67] and is particularly valuable for Monocular 3D
Detection (M3D), where unlabeled data is abundant [60,73].
Existing AL methods for M3D, such as Efficient AL [16]
and MonoLiG [15], operate at the image level. They re-
quest entire images rather than specific objects. This induces
unnecessary annotation overhead because every object in a
selected image must be labeled, including trivial or already
well-modeled instances (see Fig. 1). It also obscures the true
annotation cost, which scales with the number of instances to
be annotated [33]. As shown by Lyu et al. [33], labeling ca-
pacity is better utilized when annotating instances rather than
images. In addition, existing AL methods for M3D [15,16]
are primarily uncertainty-based and rank samples by low
predictive confidence or high disagreement (e.g., ensemble
variance). At the instance level, such criteria over-select
distant objects, as they exhibit high aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainty but deliver limited accuracy gains. We hypoth-
esize that prior work [15,16] overlooked this bias because
image-level selection compels annotating all objects in each
chosen image. This mixes informative and uninformative
instances and masks the inefficiency.
We revisit AL for M3D from a diversity perspective. First,
we formalize an instance-based AL pipeline and make the
instance the unit of annotation. Then, we introduce Instance
Diversity-Enriched Active Learning for Monocular 3D
Detection (IDEAL-M3D): The first instance-based AL method
for M3D (cf. Tab. 1). A key limitation of prior diversity-based
approaches is that they rely on features from a single detector,
which introduces model- and task-specific biases. Motivated
by information theory, our core idea is to use ensembles
for diversity-based selection. We estimate each instance’s
diversity jointly over a heterogeneous ensemble and combine
complementary representations to reduce single-model bias.
While ensembles are common for uncertainty estimation, to
the best of our knowledge this is the first use of ensembles
to drive diversity-based AL.
Our contributions include several measures to increase
the heterogeneity of the ensemble. This involves random
loss weight sampling, data sampling and the utilization of
different backbones. As an additional benefit, these choices
cut the additional training time by over 50% compared to a
vanilla ensemble. Furthermore, we add visual features from
a pre-trained image-based autoencoder to the ensemble. This
adds no extra detector-training time and lets the selection
exploit both task-related and task-independent cues.
We validate our approach on KITTI [12], Waymo [51],
and additionally on Rope3D [60] for cross-perspective ro-
bustness.
IDEAL-M3D achieves state-of-the-art results
across all datasets. On the KITTI [12] validation and test
set, it reaches 100% of the full-data performance using only
60% of the labels. In some cases, it even surpasses the

achieves over 97% accuracy with just 25% of data, while on
Waymo over 95% with just 25% of data. Finally, we propose
Normalized Area under the Requested Curve (NAURC),
a novel AL metric that allows for direct comparison across
instance- and image-based methods. The contributions of
this work are:
• We design the first instance-based AL pipeline for M3D
and show that uncertainty-based selection underper-
forms at the instance level, where it over-selects distant
objects with limited benefit.
• We introduce IDEAL-M3D, a diversity-based selector
with highly diverse ensemble features that reduces train-
ing overhead by over 50% compared to the vanilla en-
semble. Furthermore, we show that it leads to a com-
plementary performance gain when these task-related
detector features are combined with task-independent
visual features.
• Our approach is simple to implement yet achieves state-
of-the-art performance on KITTI [12], Waymo [51],
and Rope3D [60].
2. Related Work
2.1. Monocular 3D Object Detection (M3D)
Monocular 3D Detection (M3D) aims to recover 3D infor-
mation of objects from single 2D images [24,30,57,71]. The
research community has made a sustained effort to curate
datasets and benchmarks for it, such as KITTI [12], Waymo
[51], CDrone [36], Rope3D [60] and V2X-I [62,63]. Such
data often comes with additional LiDAR information, useful
for providing additional depth supervision during training
(e.g., RD3D [69], CaDDN [45], MonoNeRD [56], Oc-
cupancyM3D [39], MonoTAKD [26]). However, LiDAR
is not always available [9, 73], limiting the scalability of
the approach. Methods that rely solely on 3D bounding
box annotations such as MonoCon [27], MonoDETR [70],
2

MonoCD [57], MonoMAE [19] and MonoUNI [18] are
compelling since they use only RGB information. To com-
pensate for missing 3D information, these methods require a
large number of annotated images. Among the most recent
approaches, MonoDiff [43] frames the task as a denoising
diffusion process, and MonoLSS [23] employs Gumbel
Softmax to identify depth-relevant features. MonoLSS has
particularly strong performance and independence from Li-
DAR supervision. We primarily evaluate on the standard
benchmarks, KITTI [12] and Waymo [51], and additionally
include Rope3D [60] to assess generalization to traffic-view
scenarios.
2.2. Active Learning
AL reduces annotation costs by selecting the most infor-
mative samples for labeling. Traditional AL methods can be
divided into uncertainty-based approaches (e.g., Maximum
Entropy [48], BALD [11]), diversity-based approaches
(e.g., Core-Set [47], DiscAL [13]), and hybrid methods
[14, 67]. For an exhaustive survey on the topic, we point
to [67]. However, these methods are primarily designed for
classification tasks, whereas M3D is a regression problem.
Active Learning for 2D Object Detection.
PPAL [58]
combines weighted entropy scores with diversity filtering,
while MI-AOD [64] first performs adversarial training and
later measures uncertainty via image-instance inconsisten-
cies. During our investigation, we found that uncertainty-
based methods are not suitable for instance-based AL in 3D
object detection since they tend to be biased toward the
farthest objects in the scene.
Active Learning for 3D Object Detection.
In LiDAR-
based 3D detection, AL methods such as STONE [35] and
CRB [32] identify representative prototypes in gradient
space. STONE [35] incorporates uncertainty estimation via
Monte Carlo dropout, while CRB [32] optimizes for uniform
point density. DDFH [4] compresses high-dimensional
features and bounding box information using t-SNE [53]
and employs Gaussian mixture models for diverse sample
selection. KECOR [31] leverages neural tangent kernels to
quantify sample uniqueness. These methods address LiDAR-
specific challenges such as point density diversity [4,32]. In
contrast, monocular image-based detection requires different
handling strategies as it confronts different challenges, like
the estimation of depth from a single image.
For M3D, AL remains underexplored.
Efficient Ac-
tive Learning [16] estimates epistemic uncertainty using
heatmaps and maximizes diversity using a 2D detector
trained on MS COCO [25] but fails to integrate highly
task-related features. MonoLiG [15] is an uncertainty-based
approach that relies on a LiDAR-trained teacher and an en-
semble of five student models. This design imposes high
training costs, yet it lacks mechanisms to reduce the en-
semble overhead or to explicitly encourage ensemble diver-
sity. In our experiments, it still underperforms our approach.
In contrast, we eliminate LiDAR dependency and adopt a
diversity-driven selection tailored to M3D.
Instance-based Active Learning.
All mentioned AL meth-
ods select entire scenes or images. This requires annotating
all the objects in the image, even when they are not relevant.
On the contrary, instance-based approaches aim to identify
the individual objects which are the most informative to an-
notate. Didari et al. [10] and ViewAL [49] design specific
techniques for segmentation by selecting pixels or super-
pixels in the images. In 2D object detection, methods like
ComPAS [33] and QBox [52] rely on uncertainty, for in-
stance selection, which, as already mentioned, is suboptimal
for M3D. Instead, we use a representative-based selection.
3. IDEAL-M3D
We provide a high-level overview of IDEAL-M3D (Fig. 2).
In Sec. 3.1, we present our adaptation of the AL pipeline
to instance-based selection. The subsequent sections detail
our instance selection strategy: Sec. 3.2 adapts our diversity-
based baseline Core-Set [47] to M3D, while Sec. 3.3 and
Sec. 3.4 show how diverse ensembles and task-agnostic
features synergistically broaden feature-space coverage for
more effective selection.
3.1. Instance-Based AL for M3D
Initialization.
We begin by labeling a small random sub-
set of images to initialize the detector. Then we train our
model over multiple AL rounds. In each round, the network
runs inference on all unlabeled images. We then use the
predictions (in particular, the 2D bounding box center) to
propose candidates for labeling until the labeling budget of
the current round is exhausted.
Processing of Unlabeled Instances.
During selection, 3D
box locations are an unreliable matching criterion as depth
can be very imprecise, especially at early iterations or at
high distances. Instead, we identify the object to annotate
as the one whose 2D center is closest to the requested 2D
center. To avoid requiring the annotator to scan the entire
image, we restrict the search to a depth-dependent window
of size (rx, ry) around the predicted center; see the supple-
mentary for the precise definition of this radius. We then
select instances to label in the amounting to 5–10% of the
global budget per round. This selection lies at the core of
our approach and is detailed in the next section.
Training.
After selecting training instances, we update
the model with the loss used by the baseline detector
(MonoLSS [23], MonoCon [27]). Because only a small
set of instances is labeled, the classification head tends to
assign unlabeled objects to the background, penalizing rare
classes. Annotating all objects per image (as in image-based
AL) mitigates this but is costly; in instance-based AL, rare
classes may be missed.

Figure 2. Overview of IDEAL-M3D. Left: Our instance-based AL pipeline couples precise instance targeting with time-adaptive sampling,
minimizing expert effort while remaining training-time efficient (Sec. 3.1). Right: We maximize feature-space coverage by fusing Core-Set
selection with an explicitly diverse, fast-to-train ensemble and task-agnostic visual embeddings, yielding robust geometry-aware selection
under modest compute (Secs. 3.2 to 3.4). IDEAL-M3D uniquely integrates diversity-based selection with an ensemble purpose-built for
representational diversity in M3D, delivering label efficiency without the cost of conventional ensembles.
Hence, we introduce a binary mask Mi,j for the classi-
fication loss to ignore uncertain regions. Let the predicted
probability at pixel (i, j) for class c be ˆpc,i,j and the ground-
truth be pc,i,j. We define the binary Mask M as:

3.2. Core-Set Box3D
In our instance-based regime, popular uncertainty-based
methods underperform (cf. Tab. 2): they often select far-
away objects with high epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty,
which are less useful for M3D than closer, well-resolved
instances (cf. Sec. 7.5).
These observations motivate a
diversity-based baseline. We find that Core-Set [47], a sim-
ple diversity-based approach, performs surprisingly well in
this setting, so we adopt it as our baseline.
Core-Set selects the unlabeled instance farthest from the
labeled set in feature space. At labeling round r, with fea-
tures f(x), labeled set Dr
L, and unlabeled set Dr
U, it scores
an unlabeled instance x by
score(x) = min
z∈Dr
L
∥f(x) −f(z)∥2,
(3)
and choose the next query
x∗= arg max
x∈Dr
U
score(x).
(4)
This greedy step repeats until the round budget is exhausted.
A first weakness of the classic variant is that f(x) is a
penultimate classification feature. This is suboptimal for
M3D because they are trained to be invariant to geometric
factors (size, depth, pose) that dominate 3D detection quality.
We therefore extract features immediately before the 3D
detection heads, flatten them, and use these as f(x) in the
Core-Set distance; we refer to this instance-level adaptation
as Core-Set Box3D . These pre-head features retain the 3D
cues required for 3D box prediction, thereby aligning the
distance metric with the information actually used for M3D.
3.3. Diverse ensembles
Motivation.
One important limitation of Core-Set [47]
(and inherited by Core-Set Box3D ) is the reliance on a single
representation f(·). A single model’s inductive biases and
training dynamics (e.g., feature geometry shaped by loss
composition, augmentations, and optimization) can domi-
nate the notion of “distance,” risking that other task-relevant
modes are overlooked. We remove this single-model bias
by leveraging an ensemble. Prior work has used ensem-
bles for uncertainty-based scoring; to our knowledge, we
are the first to deploy an ensemble explicitly for diversity-
based selection in M3D. Concretely, we replace f(·) with 3
detector-specific embeddings of the same instance x, denoted
f1(x), f2(x), f3(x), and measure distances with a weighted
cosine across views:
d(xA, xB) =
X
i∈{1,2,3}
λi · dcos
 fi(xA), fi(xB)

,
(5)
where λi ≥0 and dcos(u, v) = 1−
u⊤v
∥u∥2 ∥v∥2 . We then apply
the Core-Set [47] selection in this fused space:
Dens(x | Dr
L) = min
z∈Dr
L
d(x, z).
(6)
4

x∗= arg max
x∈Dr
U
Dens(x | Dr
L).
(7)
Information Theory Intuition.
For intuition, we analyze
the ensemble representation as a concatenation Fens(x) =
[f1(x), f2(x), f3(x)] and omit x for readability. By the chain
rule of mutual information (MI),
I(Fens; Dr
L) = I(f1; Dr
L) +
3
X
m=2
I
 fm; Dr
L | f<m

≥I(f1; Dr
L).
(8)
Because the concatenation order is arbitrary, we can permute
the views so that any fm appears first, yielding:
I(Fens; Dr
L) ≥
max
m∈{1,2,3} I(fm; Dr
L).
(9)
The result in (8) and (9) gives strict gains when added
views contribute a nonredundant signal.
Efficiency.
Ensembles are often weakly diverse, since their
members often differ mainly by random initialization and
data-loading order. Also, they are slow to train. To address
both issues, we train one main model in standard fashion
(also used for evaluation) and add two auxiliary models that
are faster and intentionally diversified. We introduce the
following measures to increase representational diversity
while reducing training time:
• Heterogeneous, smaller backbones. For the auxiliary
models, we choose different backbones to induce di-
versity via both distinct architectures and initializations
from their respective pretrained weights. For fairness,
all detectors (main and auxiliary) are initialized from
ImageNet [8] pretraining. In our experiments, we use
RepViT-M1.0 [55] and MobileNet4-Conv-M [41], se-
lected for (i) reasonable accuracy and (ii) faster training
than the main model (see Fig. 12).
• Shorter schedules. Each auxiliary model trains for one
third of the main model’s epochs, retaining most of the
diversity signal while substantially reducing compute.
• Multi-task loss weighting perturbations. M3D com-
prises several subtasks (2D box, 3D offset, dimen-
sions, depth, orientation, confidence, classification).
At the start of each round r, for each auxiliary model
m we sample per-subtask Ψ loss multipliers wm
r,Ψ ∼
Uniform(1 −δ, 1 + δ) to induce mild specialization.
• Time-dependent bagging.
Later rounds dominate
training cost because the labeled set has grown, whereas
early rounds are label-sparse and benefit from using
a larger fraction of available labels; accordingly, we
adopt a decreasing subsampling schedule over training
progress. At training round r with progress t ∈[0, 1]
(where t ≜
|Dr
L|
|Dr
L|+|Dr
U|), we subsample the labeled data
with:
s(t) = 0.5 + 0.4 exp(−α t),
α > 0,
(10)
which monotonically decreases the sampled fraction
over time, using more data early and less later.
3.4. Task-agnostic features
Even with a multimodel ensemble, relying solely on task-
specific features can bias the metric toward detector idiosyn-
crasies and under-represent appearance variation. To com-
plement these signals, we augment the ensemble feature
space with task-agnostic visual features that capture object
appearance (e.g., texture, color, shape, local context).
Concretely, for each candidate instance we segment the
object with SAMv2 [44] and encode the masked crop using
a pretrained Stable Diffusion autoencoder [46] to obtain
a compact flattened visual embedding fvis(x). Since the
SAM mask is only used for feature selection and not for the
final selection itself, a slight imperfection in the mask is not
critical. We then integrate these features into our cosine-
based distance and select the highest-scoring instances for
labeling:
d(xA, xB) =
X
i∈{1,2,3,vis}
λi · dcos
 fi(xA), fi(xB)

. (11)
Because the visual embeddings are obtained from frozen
models (no additional training), the added computation is
negligible relative to detector training. Overall, our diversity-
based selection is straightforward to implement, shown in
experiments to be effective, and markedly more training-time
efficient than conventional ensembles.
4. Experiments
4.1. Datasets, Metrics, and Active Learning Setting
We evaluate on three benchmarks for monocular 3D de-
tection: KITTI [12] and Waymo monocular [45,51] (both
vehicle-mounted), and Rope3D [60] (traffic scenes with di-
verse camera perspectives [36]). Waymo and Rope3D are
large-scale datasets. MonoLSS [23] on KITTI [12] and
MonoCon [27] on Waymo [51] and Rope3D [60] are used
as baseline detectors.
• KITTI [12]. Following [6,23], we split the training set
into 3,712 images for training, 3,769 for validation, and
7,518 for testing. We report AP3D|R40 [50] (3D Aver-
age Precision at 40 recall positions) with the standard
Easy/Moderate/Hard difficulty levels, using Moderate
as the primary benchmark. For active learning, we start
from an initial 10% labeled training pool and increase
the labeled set through iterations to 15%, 20%, 30%,
40%, 50%, and 60%.

Train w/ 100% Data
Figure 3. AL training curves. Plot 1: We report the KITTI validation [12] performance for cars AP 0.7

Waymo validation [51] performance AP 0.5 for vehicles. Plots 3-4: We report the Rope3D validation performance AP 0.5
3D|R40 for Cars and
Big Vehicles. All results show mean performance across three rounds with identical initialization.
• Waymo [51]. Following the monocular setting [45],
we use front-camera images with 52,386 training
and 39,848 validation images. We report AP3D and
APH3D at IoU thresholds 0.5 and 0.7, and follow
MonoLiG [15] in using difficulty level 2. We begin
with 10% labeled images and acquire an additional 5%
per iteration up to a 25% maximum budget.
• Rope3D [60]. We use the heterologous split (chang-
ing camera views), comprising 40,333 training and
4,676 validation images. Performance is evaluated us-
ing AP3D|R40 [50] and the Rope Score [60] at IoU 0.5
and Moderate difficulty. We begin with 20% labeled
images and acquire an additional 5% per iteration up to
a 35% maximum budget.
4.2. NAURC: A budget-fair evaluation metric
The goal of AL is to maximize accuracy under a limited la-
beling budget. For comparability with prior work, we report
our main results using the two standard strategies: training
curves over requested instances [13,15,33,47,58,64,67] and
performance at fixed labeled-data percentages [16,33,35].
These approaches, however, have notable drawbacks: train-
ing curves can be ambiguous because leadership changes
across the budget, and fixed-percentage snapshots provide
only a single number that depends on the chosen percent-
age. They also do not resolve the budget-unit mismatch
between image-based methods (spending in images) and
instance-based methods (spending in instances).
To address these issues, we propose a new metric,
6

Normalized Area under the Requested Curve (NAURC).
NAURC is a single-scalar metric that integrates performance
over the requested-instance budget, normalizes by a target
budget, and enables direct comparison between image- and
instance-based methods. It enables a common instance-
based accounting for all methods: If an image-based method
overshoots the target budget, we interpolate back to the bud-
get; if it undershoots, we keep the last observed performance.
We refer to the supplementary for a formal definition and
more detailed motivation, derivation, and visualizations
.
4.3. Comparison with AL methods
In Tab. 2 and Fig. 3, we report average accuracy over
three runs initialized from the same checkpoint, comparing
IDEAL-M3D with other AL methods. Interestingly, methods
based on uncertainty significantly drop their KITTI [12] and
Rope3D [60] performance when they move from image-
based to instance-based approaches. Intuitively, this is a
result of their bias toward distant objects (Sec. 7.5), which
can be mitigated by annotating all the objects in the image.
Remarkably, with only 60% of instances, we surpass the
100% KITTI baseline, and on Rope3D we reach 97% (car)
and 107% (big vehicle) of fully supervised AP performance
using just 35% of labels. Results for the pedestrian and
cyclist class are shown in the supplementary material.
Waymo [51] shows the opposite trend: all instance-based
methods improve. We hypothesize that this stems from
strong redundancy in the dataset, as Waymo provides video
frames at 300 ms intervals [45], whereas KITTI and Rope3D
are image-based. On Waymo, we match 97% (AP0.5) and
95% (AP0.7) supervised performance with 75% fewer la-
bels. These quantitative results are supported by qualitative
evidence in Fig. 4. We observe that IDEAL-M3D tends to
prioritize nearby objects at the beginning of AL and gradu-
ally moves to more distant ones. Additionally, the detection
quality generally shows consistent improvement over time.
4.4. Comparison with fully supervised methods
To assess generalizability, we run active learning up to
60% of the KITTI trainval instances and evaluate on the
KITTI test set [12]. Test labels are not public, so evaluation
requires submission to the official server. Competing fully
supervised baselines are trained on 100% of trainval.
In Tab. 3, we compare IDEAL-M3D with recent fully su-
pervised and semi-supervised approaches. Relative to our
fully trained baseline detector MonoLSS [23], IDEAL-M3D
achieves slightly lower AP on Moderate (−0.28) and Hard
(−0.21). Yet, it attains higher AP on Easy (+0.95) while
using 40% fewer labels. IDEAL-M3D is competitive with state-
of-the-art under substantially reduced annotation. Several en-
tries are semi-supervised: Mix-Teaching [59], DPLFLEX [68],
and MonoLiG [15] leverage additional unlabeled data during

ods on the KITTI [12] test set for the car category. SSL denotes

In contrast, IDEAL-M3D uses RGB images only.
4.5. Ablation Study
We perform our main ablation study in Tab. 4 using
NAURC60% AP Mod. as the primary metric. Surprisingly,
moving from image-based Core-Set [47] to a na¨ıve instance-
based Core-Set lowers performance from 13.50 to 13.16 AP
Mod. We hypothesize two causes. First, monocular 3D de-
tection is dominated by 3D box estimation (especially depth),
while penultimate classification features over-emphasize se-
mantics and are invariant to geometry. Second, image-based
selection may benefit from an averaging effect: labeling one
image annotates all objects, so even suboptimal choices of-
ten include informative instances. Aligning the selection
space with the detection task, i.e. replacing classification
features with pre-head detection features (Core-Set Box3D ),
more than recovers this loss.
Building on this representation, the diverse ensemble
(Sec. 3.3) contributes +0.72 AP Mod. Adding task-agnostic
visual embeddings (Sec. 3.4) yields a larger +1.27 AP
Mod. This shows that appearance cues complement task-
conditioned geometry. The visual pathway adds negligible
overhead because embeddings are computed with frozen en-
coders (Tab. 5). This preserves our favorable runtime profile.
Using both sources together, detector-specific geometry and
detector-agnostic appearance, adds a further +1.64 and +1.09
AP Mod. This aligns with our mutual-information view of
non-redundant signals. Notice, that in an image-based selec-
tion setting, our approach still exceeds the classical Core-Set
baseline by +1.33 AP Mod.
4.6. Training-time efficiency
In Tab. 5, we report the training-time ablation on the
KITTI validation set [12]. The Core-Set Box3D baseline
trains for 18.2h. IDEAL-M3D requires 33.7h in total. Using
an ensemble of three models therefore increases training
time by only 85% relative to Core-Set Box3D . In contrast, a

vanilla ensemble like Inst Ens Depth Var would naively incur
a 200% increase (approximately 3× the baseline). Among
our efficiency measures, shortening the training schedule
(fewer epochs) is the most effective. Time-dependent bag-
ging (subsampling more aggressively later) provides the
next-largest savings. Smaller, heterogeneous backbones fur-
ther reduce cost. Together, these measures offset most of the
multi-model overhead. Finally, adding task-agnostic visual
diversity increases total time by only 1% because the visual
embeddings are computed with frozen models and require
no additional detector training.
5. Conclusion
We introduced IDEAL-M3D, the first instance-based active
learning framework for monocular 3D object detection. We
show that diversity-driven ensembles are highly effective for
instance selection when representational diversity is explic-
itly maximized. Our design relies on simple mechanisms that
increase diversity without heavy training overhead. We also
integrate appearance coverage via task-agnostic visual em-
beddings at negligible cost. Overall, our approach improves
label efficiency while keeping computation modest.
Extensive experiments support these claims across three
datasets: KITTI, Waymo, and Rope3D, including results
on the private KITTI test set. On KITTI, we match fully
supervised accuracy using only 60% of the labeled data. The
pipeline is simple to implement and robust in practice.
A limitation is that our approach does not explicitly
address extreme class imbalance, where ultra-rare categories
may be undersampled. Future work will incorporate multi-
modal cues (e.g., LiDAR-derived multi-view images, video)
to further diversify signals, and explore semi-supervised
learning where feature similarity can guide high-quality
pseudo-label selection.

6.1. Problem Statement
6.1.1
Monocular 3D Object Detection (M3D).
Monocular 3D Detection (M3D) predicts categories and 3D
bounding boxes Bi for objects in an RGB image I with
intrinsics K ∈R3×4. Each Bi is parameterized by posi-
tion (xi, yi, zi) ∈R3, dimensions (wi, hi, li) ∈R3, ori-
entation Ri ∈SO(3), and class ci ∈N. Given a dataset
{(Ij, Kj, B(Ij))}M
j=1, with B(Ij) as ground-truth boxes for
image Ij, the goal is to train a model capable of predicting
B(I) for any given image I. Starting solely from a 2D RGB
image poses a significant challenge due to depth ambiguity.
6.1.2
Active Learning.
Active Learning (AL) starts with a small labeled dataset
D0
L = {(Ii, Ki, B(Ii))} and a large unlabeled dataset
DU = {(Ij, Kj)}.
In each round r, we select D∗
r =
{(Ij, Kj, S∗
j,r)}j∈J ∗
r , where J ∗
r is the set of selected im-
ages and S∗
j,r ⊆ˆB(Ij) the subset of bounding boxes cho-
sen for labeling. The oracle Ω: (I, ˆB) 7→B ∪{null},
which in practice corresponds to a human annotator, re-
fines each selected ˆBj,k ∈S∗
j,r, returning Bj,k or, in case
it is not labeled, null. The labeled dataset is updated as
Dr
L = D0
L
∪
Sr
r′=1{(Ij, Kj, {Bj,k}k∈S∗
j,r′) | ˆBj,k ̸=
null}, and the model is fine-tuned on Dr
L. This repeats
until the total labeled bounding boxes reach the budget
T = PR
r=1
P
j∈J ∗
r |S∗
j,r|. In summary, AL pipelines can
be seen as iterative cycles that repeat two steps: data selec-
tion for labeling, and training.
6.2. Loss Functions
We detail the loss computations for our baseline methods
and omit the loss weights for clarity.
MonoLSS [23]:
L =Lcls + Lc,o + Lh,w + LS3d+
Lθ + Ldepth · Sample S
(12)
MonoCon [27]:
L =Lcls + Lc,o + Lh,w + Ldepth + LS3d+
Lθ + Lkp,h + Lkp,o + Lkp,co
(13)
The individual losses can be categorized into image- and
object-related losses.
6.2.1
Image-level Losses
The following losses are image-specific. Therefore, we apply
the masking strategy as described in cf. Sec. 3.1 on both of
these losses:
• Lcls: Gaussian kernel weighted focal loss for classifi-
cation, following CenterNet [72].
• Lkp,h: (MonoCon only) Gaussian weighted focal loss
for projected 3D keypoints as an auxiliary task.
12

6.2.2
Object-level Losses
These losses are specific to objects and do not require spe-
cialized masking:
• Lc,o: L1 Loss for offset from most confident foreground
bin to precise projected 3D center
• Lh,w: L1 loss for 2D height and width
• LS3d: Dimension-loss. Dimension-aware L1 loss (L1
loss normalized by ground truth) in case of MonoCon
and L1 loss in case MonoLSS
• Ldepth: Laplacian aleatoric uncertainty loss
• Lθ: Multi-bin loss following Mousavian et al. [37]
• Lkp,o: L1 loss for keypoint offsets from keypoint
heatmap
• Lkp,co: L1 loss for keypoint offsets from projected 3D
center
6.3. Obtaining Diverse Features
Ensemble Features
When extracting features for Core-Set
Box3D we orientate on our baseline detectors. The idea is
simple: We use the features that lead to a bounding box
prediction. For MonoLSS [23] we use the region of interest
(RoI) features of dimension d x 7 x 7, while for MonoCon
[27] we use the features of size d x 3 x 3. Before applying
Core-Set [47] selection, the tensors are flattened into a single
dimensional vector.
For our main model we employ the standard DLA-34 [61]
backbone (d = 64). For our auxiliary models we replace the
DLA-34 with the backbones of RepVIT M [55] (d = 56)
and MobileNetv4 M [41] (d = 48). These models are
very lightweight in terms of parameters and still offer an
acceptable 2D and 3D detection performance, while being
easily interchangeable with minimal code modifications (cf.
Fig. 12).
Visual Features
The extraction of visual features follows
a two step process. First we mask the image, then we encode
it using an off-the-shelf image autoencoder.
To ensure compatibility with Core-Set selection, all object
features must share the same dimensionality, yet the pixel
space of instances differs. For example, a car closer to the
camera has a larger pixel height than a car further away.
While resizing objects to a fixed size is a straightforward
solution, we adopt a more effective strategy (cf. Tab. 6).
Specifically, we crop each object to a fixed height and width
of 320×320 pixels, centering the crop on the 2D center of
the object. If the object lies near the image boundary, we
apply padding using the background color. We resize the
cropped region to 128x128 pixels before feeding it into the
Table 6. Ablation study on the KITTI [12] validation set show-
ing the effect of resizing. Results are reported using NAURC60%
AP3D|R40 for cars (IoU 0.7) and pedestrians/cyclists (IoU 0.5).

autoencoder. We utilize the autoencoder of Stable Diffusion
v2-base [46] for this purpose.
Our approach ensures that the visual features effectively
capture both the object’s 2D size and depth through the
fixed cropping strategy, which preserves relative scale and
encourages depth-diversity. Additionally, the resized crop
maintains the object’s visual characteristics, enabling the
autoencoder to learn a rich, low-dimensional representation
of the visual appearance.
For segmentation [44], we utilize the SAMv2 ViT-B [44]
architecture on Rope3D [60] and Waymo [51] and the larger
SAMv2 ViT-L [44] variant on KITTI [12].
7. Experiments
7.1. NAURC Evaluation Metric
A central challenge in AL evaluation is to obtain a scalar,
budget-aware summary that is comparable across selection
paradigms. Previous work typically use two approaches: (i)
training curves that plot performance against the number of
labeled instances on the x-axis [13, 15, 33, 47, 58, 64, 67];
while informative, rankings often swap across budgets/time,
complicating objective comparison; and (ii) fixed-budget
snapshots that report performance at selected percentages
of labeled data [16, 33, 35]; these yield a single value but
depend on the chosen percentage and ignore the rest of the
trajectory.
We introduce the Normalized Area under the Requested
Curve (NAURC) to provide a fair, single-scalar comparison
across image- and instance-based methods. NAURC adopts
a common instance-based accounting for all approaches: for
image-based selection, each selected image contributes the
number of labelable instances it contains (the budget accu-
mulates the total instances from the chosen images); for
instance-based selection, the budget counts all requested
instances, including requests that are later deemed non-
labelable, thereby reflecting annotator verification effort.
NAURC normalizes by a target budget and handles bud-
get mismatch robustly: if a method overshoots the budget,
we linearly interpolate back to it; if it undershoots, we keep
the last observed performance (no extrapolation).
13

Empirical motivation for instance-based accounting.
We analyze the relationship between actually labeled in-
stances and the allocated budget in Fig. 5. For image-based
methods, we quantify the budget at each AL iteration in terms
of actually labeled boxes, since these methods request whole
images. Most image-based strategies, with the exception
of Img Random, tend to select images containing above-
average numbers of instances, revealing that an image-count
budget unfairly mixes annotation efforts because images
vary widely in object count. For instance-based methods, the
labeled ratio captures the proportion of true positive requests.
Because false positive requests still require annotator verifi-
cation, they count against the budget. This slightly penalizes
instance-based methods compared to image-based methods.
However, it also considers the annotators effort to verify that
a requested object is a false positive.

Figure 6. Visualization of the Normalized Area under the Requested
Curve computation. For methods exceeding the label budget xbudget,
the final performance metric is interpolated.
Formally, we compute the metric as the Area under the
Requested Curve (AURC) up until the total requested label
budget xbudget normalized by xbudget (refer to Fig. 6). The
NAURC is defined as:
NAURCxbudget =
1
xbudget
 
AURCfinal +
k
X
i=0
AURCi
!
,
(14)
where k denotes the last AL iteration before reaching the
requested instance label budget xbudget:
k = max {i | xi+1 ≤xbudget} .
(15)
We compute the metric across iterations using the trapezoidal
rule to calculate the AURC between consecutive data points.
AURCi = (yi+1 + yi)
2
· (xi+1 −xi),
(16)
where yi and yi+1 are the metric values at the i-th and (i+1)-
th AL iteration and xi and xi+1 are their respective requested
instance labels. The AURC of the final interval is computed
as:
AURCfinal = (yinterpolated + yk)
2
· (xbudget −xk),
(17)
where yinterpolated is the metric value at the budget point. To
handle both cases where methods exceed or fall short of the
target budget, we define:
yinterpolated =
(
yk + ∆y · xbudget−xk
xk+1−xk
if xk+1 > xbudget
yk
otherwise
(18)
where ∆y = yk+1 −yk.
Compared to prior AUC-style metrics [65–67], NAURC
enables fair cross-paradigm comparison across image- and
instance-based methods: If a method overshoots the bud-
get, NAURC linearly interpolates the terminal performance at
xbudget; if it undershoots, it holds the last observed value.
This removes extrapolation and prevents artificial inflation.
7.2. Implementational Details
Active Learning Parameters.
The distance weights (cf.
Eq. (5)) are determined as λ1 = λ2 = λ3 = 1
6, with λvis
set to 1
2 to balance the contribution of visibility metrics.
The Loss weight multiplier parameter is set to δ = 0.2 For
adaptive sampling, we configure the time-dependent decay
parameter α to 3.0 for KITTI [12] and 30.0 for Rope3D [60]
and Waymo [51] to account for the different datase size. On
KITTI [12], labeling proposals exclude objects with heights
below 25 pixels, as ground truth instances are constrained to
a minimum height of 25 pixels, which eliminates unsuitable
candidates during this process. All experiments, including
run time evaluations, are conducted on a single NVIDIA A40
GPU with 32GB RAM. For instance-based AL, we mitigate
redundant labeling by skipping requests for objects that fall
within 95% of the radius (rx, ry) from a previous request
14

and share the same predicted class. This prevents repeated
annotations or requests regarding the same false-positive
predictions. For masking and visual feature extraction, we
leverage the 2D bounding box predictions of the main model.
To accelerate computation, we apply principal component
analysis (PCA) to the extracted features, compressing the
dimensions while retaining at least 99% of the variance.
MonoLSS [23] Configuration.
The training setup uti-
lizes a batch size of 16 and optimizes the model using the
Adam [20] optimizer with a weight decay of 1e-5. Starting
from a pre-trained checkpoint, each AL iteration spans 150
epochs for the main model. During training, we initialize
the learning rate at 1e-3 and decay it by a factor of 0.1 after
60% and 80% of the epochs. Additionally, the first cycle
incorporates a 5-epoch cosine warmup to stabilize gradient
updates. After the initial phase of training, the LSS module
gets activated at the 50th epoch. To enhance model robust-
ness, we apply comprehensive data augmentation techniques,
including random horizontal flipping, shifting (W: ±256 pix-
els, H: ±77 pixels), scaling (0.6-1.4), and MixUp3D using
fully labeled images.
MonoCon [27] configuration.
For MonoCon, we adopt a
batch size of 24 and train the model using the AdamW [29]
optimizer with a weight decay of 1e-5 and a learning rate of
0.0011. The initial training phase encompasses 90 epochs,
followed by an additional 30 epochs for every subsequent AL
cycle. To maintain stable training, we implement gradient
clipping with a norm of 35 and apply cosine learning rate
scheduling. For computational efficiency, images are resized
to 960×640 pixels, in line with the settings from [36]. The
augmentation pipeline integrates a rich variety of transforma-
tions, including photometric distortion, random shift (± 32
pixels), horizontal flipping, and random cropping (900×550
pixels). Furthermore, for Rope3D [60], we learn the SO(3)
orientation matrix in alignment with the GroundMix [36]
approach.
Labeling radius.
Also, to simplify the task for the labeler,
we expect that an object lies within a depth-dependent radius
(rx, ry), letting the user focus on a small area. Such radius
is defined as:
rx = H · fx
ˆz ,
ry = H · fy
ˆz ,
(19)
where H is a scaling factor, (fx, fy) are the camera focal
lengths, and ˆz is the predicted depth. This ensures accurate
targeting by accounting for the geometric effects of depth,
as pixel-space errors decrease with distance. We define the
labeling radius via H = 2.0, which corresponds to approxi-
mately 47 pixels for objects at a 30m distance on KITTI [12].
Instance matching between ensemble members.
Using
the predictions from the main model as a reference, we as-
sociate predictions from auxiliary models by calculating
the 2D bounding box IoU. This computation uses a relaxed
threshold of 0.5 to accommodate additional object matches.
As auxiliary models are trained with fewer resources, we
adjust detection thresholds to compensate for their lower
capacity. Specifically, thresholds are reduced from 0.2 to 0.1
for MonoCon [27] and from 0.2 to 0.05 for MonoLSS [23].
For cases of multiple associations, we prioritize the object
with the highest confidence score. This strategy significantly
enhances instance coverage, particularly for rare and low-
confidence objects, while maintaining diversity and minimiz-
ing discard rates.
7.3. Implementation Details of Baseline Methods
For completeness, we provide additional implementation
details for a subset of our baseline methods. In our evalua-
tion framework, we adapt image-based methods by selecting
images based on their highest-scoring contained instance,
while instance-based methods directly employ our labeling
pipeline (Sec. 3.1) with their respective acquisition func-
tions. To manage computational resources effectively, we
implement dataset-specific sampling strategies: For datasets
containing on average more than 10 objects per image (e.g.
Rope3D [60]), we limit the maximum number of requested
images to one-third of the number of instances, though this
restriction is not applied to KITTI [12] due to its limited size.
In the following, we provide further details on the individual
baseline methods.
Augmentation Depth Variance (Augm Depth Var):
This method provides a computationally efficient alternative
to ensemble approaches by employing multiple augmented
forward passes of a single model. The augmentation pipeline
includes blur (σ = 0.5), brightness adjustments (factors: 0.5-
1.5, probability: 0.2-0.5), and hue shifts (±0.1). We exclude
this method for MonoCon [27] evaluations due to its built-in
color augmentation during training.
CDAL [1]: This approach implements Core-Set sam-
pling by computing class-wise confusions from softmax
probabilities of both labeled data heatmap indices and pre-
dictions. The sampling strategy employs pairwise and class-
wise KL divergence for measuring image similarity.
CloseDepth: Instances with low depth values are pre-
ferred for labeling.
Confidence (Conf): This uncertainty-based approach
combines depth and classification confidence scores from
the detector, selecting instances with lower confidence for
labeling prioritization.
DDFH [4]: DDFH is the current state-of-the-art method
for active learning in LiDAR-based 3D detection. The ap-
proach optimizes three key aspects: balancing class distri-
bution, maximizing frame-level heterogeneity, and selecting

diverse instances. For instance diversity, it fits a Gaussian
mixture model to t-SNE [53] compressed model features
and additional geometric features. We adapt this approach
to monocular 3D detection by dropping the point density
information from the feature vectors.
BADGE [3]: BADGE computes gradient embeddings
derived from the penultimate classification layer for each
data point and selects samples via the k-MEANS++ seeding
algorithm [2]. We compute gradients based on the focal loss
for the predicted heatmap locations on an instance basis.
ComPAS [33]: We adapted the active learning com-
ponent of ComPAS [citation] to our setting, which selects
instances based on their localization and classification dis-
agreement between a chairman and its committee members.
This disagreement is measured using multiple data augmen-
tations, including scale, shift, contrast, solarize, saturation,
sharpness, and brightness.
Dropout-based Methods:
We investigated dropout-
based uncertainty estimation but excluded it from our fi-
nal evaluation due to significant performance degradation.
Specifically, when applying dropout to backbone features,
we observed substantial drops in accuracy: While the base-
line achieves 18.29 for Car AP IoU=0.7
3D|R40
Moderate, introduc-
ing dropout rates of 1%, 5%, and 10% reduces performance
to 17.73, 15.81, and 13.67 on the KITTI [12] validation set,
respectively (baseline: MonoLSS [23]).
Efficient AL [16]: We excluded Efficient AL [16] from
our comparison due to ambiguous evaluation metrics (un-
specified IoU thresholds for mAP and no differentiation
between KITTI [12]’s easy, moderate, and hard instances).
Ensemble Depth Variance (Ens Depth Var): Using an
ensemble of three models, we associate predictions via a
2D IoU threshold of 0.5. The uncertainty metric is derived
from the variance of depth predictions relative to their mean,
prioritizing instances exhibiting higher variance.
Ensemble Relative Standard Deviation (Ens Rel Std):
Similar to Ens Depth Var, but normalizes the depth standard
deviation by the mean predicted depth.

Oversampling).
FarDepth: Instances with large depth values are pre-
ferred for labeling. Predicted instances need to have a 2D
height of at least 25 pixels and a depth smaller 50m.
MonoLiG [15]: MonoLiG [15] combines AL with semi-
supervised learning by leveraging an ensemble of five mod-
els alongside a LiDAR-based teacher model. The instance
selection strategy integrates three uncertainty measures: the
aleatoric uncertainty of the teacher model, the disagreement
among ensemble members, and the teacher-student predic-
tion inconsistency. These measures are aggregated into a
unified scoring mechanism for ranking potential labeling
candidates. Due to unavailability of the official implementa-
tion at submission time, we report the results from the paper.
To establish a fair comparison, we estimate the number of
labeled instances per AL iteration based on the dataset’s av-
erage object count per image.
7.4. Comparison with AL methods
We provide additional comparisons to contextualize the
main results in Tab. 2. Final accuracies at the end of AL train-
ing are summarized in Tab. 8, and the corresponding training
curves are shown in Figs. 7 to 9, offering both endpoint and
trajectory views of performance.
Per-class results on KITTI for pedestrian and cyclist are
reported in Fig. 7 and Tab. 7. IDEAL-M3D significantly out-
performs all baselines on Car and Pedestrian. While Com-
PAS [33], Core-Set Box3D BADGE [3], and DDFH [4] report
higher AP on Cyclist, this comes from a highly skewed bud-
get allocation: they assign up to 7× more annotations to
Cyclist at the expense of the other classes (cf. Fig. 10). In
contrast, IDEAL-M3D maintains a balanced acquisition across
categories, which we hypothesize emerges from the repre-
sentational diversity of our ensembles. This yields stronger
average performance and a more uniform gain among all
classes.
7.5. Uncertainty vs. Diversity-based Methods
To understand why uncertainty-based methods are less
effective for instance-based M3D (cf. Tab. 2), we conduct
a detailed analysis comparing Core-Set Box3D with three

Figure 11. Comparison of instance-based active learning meth-
ods for monocular 3D detection. Uncertainty-based methods tend
to select distant objects, which provide weaker training signals,
while diversity-based approaches favor closer objects that are more
informative. Left: The effectiveness of various selection strategies.
Right: Distribution of selected instances, showing diversity-based

based methods’ bias toward moderately far and distant objects.
distinct selection patterns: Both Conf and Ens Depth Var
demonstrate a clear bias towards distant objects, which
is expected given that absolute depth errors typically in-
crease with distance. In contrast, Ens Rel Std achieves more
balanced sampling across different depths, while Core-Set
Box3D shows a preference for closer objects. We hypothesize
that closer objects generally provide richer visual informa-
tion due to higher pixel density and more distinct features,
making them more conducive to accurate depth learning.
Interestingly, diversity-based methods also tend to perform
better for far away objects (hard category, cf. Tab. 2), even
though they are undersampled during training time. To fur-
ther investigate this, we introduce two simple AL strategies:
• CloseDepth: Prioritizes close instances for labeling
• FarDepth: Prioritizes most distant instances (filtered to
instances ≤25 pixels and ≤50m depth to avoid false
positives)
Our experiments in Fig. 11 show that CloseDepth per-
forms second-best after Core-Set Box3D , leading to two
key insights. First, closer instances provide more effective
training signals, even for detecting distant objects. Second,
uncertainty-based methods are suboptimal for instance-based
M3D due to their inherent bias towards moderate far and dis-
tant objects
7.6. Training time comparison with fully supervised
methods
We compare total training time in Tab. 9 against fully
supervised and semi-supervised baselines.
Relative to
MonoLSS [23], IDEAL-M3D trains for roughly twice as long.
It reaches (near) fully supervised accuracy using only 60%
of the labeled data on the validation and test sets. Since
compute is typically far cheaper than human annotation, this
is a favorable trade-off.
Compared to MonoLiG [15], IDEAL-M3D achieves higher
accuracy on KITTI validation and test (cf. Tab. 3 and Fig. 3).
It also reduces training time by about 3×. This efficiency
stems from concrete design choices. MonoLiG trains an en-
semble of five image-based student models and an additional
sixth LiDAR-based model. In contrast, we train only three
models. Our auxiliary ensemble components are lightweight
and fast to train.
We also compare with the semi-supervised Mix-
Teaching [59]. Its training time is more than 4× higher.
The method trains a five-model ensemble across one super-
vised and three semi-supervised rounds, which introduces
substantial overhead. In contrast, IDEAL-M3D attains higher
KITTI test accuracy without using unlabeled data and with
fewer labeled samples (cf. Tab. 3).

7.7. Backbone ablation
To promote ensemble diversity while keeping com-
pute modest, we equip the auxiliary models with distinct
lightweight backbones (cf. Sec. 3.3). We evaluate several
candidates on KITTI [12] validation set using 100% of the
training data to isolate backbone effects. Throughput and
accuracy are summarized in Fig. 12.
For the main model, we retain DLA-34 [61] due to its
strong accuracy, ensuring a fair and comparable reference
across experiments. This backbone remains fixed in all
primary results.
For the auxiliary models, we select RepViT-M1.0 [55]
and MobileNetV4-Conv-M [41]. MobileNetV4-Conv-M
offers the best speed–accuracy trade-off among the tested
lightweight backbones, being both faster and more accurate
than alternatives. ConvNeXt-Pico [28] is marginally faster
than RepViT-M1.0 but is approximately 25% less accurate;
we therefore prefer RepViT-M1.0. Together, RepViT-M1.0
and MobileNetV4-Conv-M provide complementary induc-
tive biases and increase architectural diversity at low training
cost.

7.8. Feature diversity ablation
A key component of our approach is instance selection
driven by diverse, fast-to-train feature ensembles. We in-
crease diversity and reduce compute through four comple-
mentary mechanisms: (i) heterogeneous lightweight back-
bones, (ii) time-adaptive data sampling that varies the train-
ing trajectory across ensemble members, (iii) fewer training
epochs for auxiliary models, and (iv) random sampling of
loss weights to perturb optimization and feature emphasis

across tasks/heads.
Together, these mechanisms reduce total training time
by approximately 15 hours compared to a vanilla, homoge-
neous ensemble trained for full schedules, while improving
selection quality through more diverse feature views.
The ablation in Tab. 10 supports this design. Reducing
epochs on auxiliary models preserves performance to within
noise levels, indicating that full schedules are unnecessary
for effective feature-based selection. Adding backbone di-
versity, time-adaptive sampling, and random loss-weight
sampling yields incremental gains in AP3D|R40 (Moderate)
of +1.10, +0.85, and +0.63, respectively.
We further analyze feature diversity in Fig. 13 via t-
SNE [53]. Ensembles using time-adaptive sampling and het-
erogeneous backbones exhibit markedly lower inter-model
feature correlation than a vanilla ensemble, confirming that
our mechanisms produce complementary representations
that enhance the quality of selected instances.
7.9. Visual diversity ablation
In Tab. 11, we ablate components that promote visual
diversity in the feature ensemble.
Removing Segment Anything Model 2 (SAMv2) reduces
AP3D (Moderate) by more than 2 points. We hypothe-
size two causes. First, without SAMv2, background content
leaks into the features. The same object with different back-
20

grounds then appears artificially diverse, which dilutes fore-
ground cues. Second, the foreground mask carries coarse
geometric information. E.g, the silhouette of a car at 45◦
yaw differs from one at 0◦, which is useful for 3D selection.
Replacing the autoencoder with DINOv2 [38] features
causes a similar drop. DINOv2 emphasizes global scene
semantics. It captures less local, instance-centric detail [54].
The autoencoder yields object-focused representations that
better support instance selection.
Fig. 14 shows t-SNE [53] visualizations of autoencoder
features and detector features. The two spaces exhibit mini-
mal correlation. This indicates that the task-agnostic autoen-
coder provides complementary signals to the task-specific
model features.
