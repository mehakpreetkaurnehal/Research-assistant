Lithium halides with the general formula LixMyX6, where M indicates transition metal ions
and X halide anions are very actively studied as solid-state electrolytes, because of relatively low
cost, high stability and Li conductivity. The structure and properties of these halide-based solid
electrolytes (HSE) can be tuned by alloying, e.g. using different halides and/or transition metals
simultaneously. The large chemical space is difficult to sample by experiments, making simulations
based on broadly applicable machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) a promising approach
to elucidate structure-property relations, and facilitate the design of better-performing compositions.
Here we focus on the Li3YCl6xBr6(1–x) system, for which reliable experimental data exists, and use
the recently-developed PET-MAD universal MLIP to investigate the structure of the alloy, the
interplay of crystalline lattice, volume and chemical composition, and its effect on Li conductivity.
We find that the distribution of Cl and Br atoms is only weakly correlated, and that the primary
effect of alloying is to modulate the lattice parameter – although it can also trigger transition between
different lattice symmetries. By comparing constant-volume and constant-pressure simulations, we
disentangle the effect of lattice parameter and chemical composition on the conductivity, finding
that the two effects compensate each other, reducing the overall dependency of conductivity on
alloy composition. We also study the effect of Y-In metal substitution finding a small increase in
the conductivity for the C2/m phase at 25% In content, and an overall higher conductivity for the
P¯3m1 phase.

INTRODUCTION
All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) are at the center of
scientific investigation as the principal power source for
next-generation electric vehicles (EVs)1,2. Compared to
conventional batteries, ASSBs swap highly flammable
liquid electrolytes for much safer solid-state electrolytes
(SSEs), which potentially enable shorter charging times
without electrolyte polarization3 and much higher energy
density4. Among the many classes of SSE, the halide-
based solid electrolytes (HSE), with general formula of
Li3MX6 (M = In, Y, Sc, or Er, etc., X = Cl or Br), have
gained more and more interest5–11 thanks to a combina-
tion of high ionic conductivity, relatively low production
cost and good air/moisture stability with respect to other
classes of SSE such as sulfides and oxides.
HSE have
been studied for almost 30 years as a possible choice for
SSE, but they became popular in 2018 when Asano and
collaborators8 used different synthesis methods to obtain
two compounds with high room temperature (RT) ionic
conductivity: 0.051 S/m for Li3YCl6, and 0.17 S/m for
Li3YBr6. This work sparked an interest in halide-based
SSE and showed that the use of different halogens can
significantly affect conductivity and structure. In partic-
ular, Li3YCl6 was found in the trigonal (P¯3m1) phase
while Li3YBr6 was in the monoclinic (C2/m) structure.
Different experiments agree that Li3YBr6 has higher con-
ductivity than Li3YCl6, but they disagree on the effect
of alloying. van der Maas et al. 12 finds an increase of
conductivity upon doping Li3YCl6 with Br in the P¯3m1
symmetry, and that Li3YBr6 has the highest conductivity
at a low level of Cl doping. They also reports a consider-
ably higher conductivity for Li3YBr6 (0.47 S/m) than the
one obtained by Asano et al. 8. Liu et al. 13, instead, finds
an increase in conductivity for the 1:1 alloy Li3YBr3Cl3,
that maintains a C2/m symmetry.
Despite the experimental evidence of the importance
of the halogen substitution, detailed computational stud-
ies of its effect on conductivity are lacking, mainly be-
cause most studies rely on density functional theory
(DFT) to obtain an accurate description of the SSE’s
properties14–17.
Quantum mechanical approaches are
quite accurate and can provide insightful evidence of rel-
evant effects16,18–20, but they are burdened by a high
computational cost that limits their applicability to small
systems not suited to capture the study of the disorder
that can arise from the substitution of halogen atoms.
To address this cost/accuracy tradeoff one can use ma-
chine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which,
once properly trained over accurate quantum mechan-
ical data, have the accuracy of DFT at a cost only
marginally higher than classical force fields21–33. Accu-
rate MLIPs can be used to study the conduction prop-
erties of SSE34–43 but they have traditionally relied on
the availability of an accurate and dedicated training
dataset, which can be complicated to generate and can
require significant computational effort, in particular for
chemically diverse compounds such as LixMyX6. In re-
cent years, so-called universal MLIPs44–47 have been con-
structed by training on a large dataset48 that spans the
whole periodic table.
These potentials are capable of
providing (semi)quantitative results in principle, out-of-
the-box, without the need for further training, or with
minimal fine-tuning on a small dataset for specific appli-
cations.
In this work, we study the effects of alloying on

the structures,
phase stability and conductivity of
Li3YCl6xBr6(1−x) using a universal potential, called
PET-MAD, which is based on the Point Edge Trans-
former (PET) architecture49 trained on the Massive
Atomic Diversity (MAD) dataset48.
II.
METHODS
A.
Universal potential and model architecture
The calculations in this work are made with MLIPs
based on the Point Edge Transformer (PET) architec-
ture49, a graph neural network (GNN) that has demon-
strated state-of-the-art accuracy on diverse molecular
and materials benchmarks.
At each message-passing
layer l, PET maintains and refines feature vectors, or
messages, f l
ij ∈RdPET associated with each ordered pair
of atoms i, j within the specified cutoff distance, and
where dPET is the embedding dimension chosen as hy-
perparameter. These messages are updated by an arbi-
trarily deep transformer50,51, applied independently to
the neighborhood of every central atom i. For atom i
at layer l, the transformer (shared across central atoms i
and unique for each GNN layer l) takes the collection of
incoming messages {f l
ji}j from all neighbors j as input
tokens, performs a permutationally covariant sequence-
to-sequence transformation, and returns the set of out-
going messages {f l+1
ij
}j from the central atom to all the
neighbors.
The target property, such as potential en-
ergy, is obtained by applying feed-forward neural net-
works to representations f l
ij and summing all the contri-
butions over bonds and layers.
The base PET model,
unlike other common frameworks22,23,25,52,53, operates
directly on the Cartesian coordinates of the neighbors,
avoiding the need for a symmetric invariant (or equivari-
ant) descriptor, which, in turn, leads to a favorable bal-
ance between model expressivity and computational cost.
Rotational invariance is learned during training through
data augmentations. Recent work from Langer et al.54
showed that not-symmetrized PET can learn rotational
symmetry and accurately predict observables to a very
high degree of rotational equivariance.
To use a potential that could handle the large chem-
ical diversity typical of these materials, we used the
newly developed universal machine learning potential
PET-MAD47. It is a model based on the PET architec-
ture, trained over the Massive Atomic Diversity (MAD)
dataset48, which consists of 95595 structures, containing
85 elements in total (with atomic numbers ranging from
1 to 86, excluding Astatine). PET-MAD proved to be
sufficiently accurate to allow direct application to a vari-
ety of different systems, including SSE47. To validate the
capability of our potential on describing halides SSE, we
also fine-tuned the model on a dataset of halides SSE.
B.
Training set construction and validation of the
ML models
We construct the training set for the ML models in
an iterative fashion.
We explored the configurational
space of Li3YBr6 and Li3YCl6 using the universal po-
tential to generate structures. Then we randomly sub-
stituted some Br atoms with Cl and vice versa to com-
pletely explore the chemical space.
To evaluate refer-
ence energetics for the specific dataset, we used the same
parameters used for PET-MAD, to keep the fine-tuning
empirically consistent. The MAD dataset, as reported
in Ref.48, is constructed using the Quantum Espresso
v7.2 package55–58, using the PBEsol exchange-correlation
functional59, which has good accuracy for solids, and the
standard solid-state pseudopotential library (SSSP) v1.2
(efficiency set)60, with a plane-wave cutoff of 110 Ry and
a charge-density cutoff of 1320 Ry. Electronic smearing
and partial occupancies were described with a Marzari-
Vanderbilt-DeVita-Payne cold smearing61 with a spread
of 0.01 Ry. In all periodic dimensions, the first Brillouin
zone was sampled with a Γ-centered grid with a resolu-
tion of 0.125 ˚A−1.
C.
Green-Kubo theory
The ionic conductivities, σ, are computed via the
Green-Kubo theory of linear response62,63, which is a
practical framework for computing transport coefficients
of extended systems64–67. For an isotropic system of N
interacting particles, it reads:
σ =
Ω
3kBT
Z ∞
0
⟨Jq(Γt) · Jq(Γ0)⟩dt,
(1)
where Ωis the cell volume, kB is the Boltzmann constant,
T the temperature, and Γt indicates the time evolution
of a point in phase space from the initial condition Γ0,
over which the average ⟨·⟩is performed. Jq is the charge
flux, which depends only on the velocities of the atoms,
vi, and their charges, qi:
Jq = e
Ω
X
i
qivi.
(2)
Here, the sum runs over all the atoms, e is the electron
charge, and the qi are equal to the nominal oxidation
numbers of the atoms.68.
D.
Molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo
simulations
Li3YCl6xBr6(1–x) has been reported in the P¯3m1 and
C2/m phases, and in this work, we investigate the de-
pendence of ionic conductivity on material composition
for both phases in their fully ordered structure8,69. The

3
conductivity, σ, is obtained from MD simulations us-
ing MLIPs developed in Sec. II B and implemented in
LAMMPS70,71.
Two different simulation protocols are
employed, depending on whether the system contains a
single halide species (Li3YBr6 or Li3YCl6) or a mixed
halide composition (Li3YCl6xBr6(1–x)). For pure halide
systems, we first perform a short 20 ps NpT equilibration
run, followed by a 3 ns NpT production simulation from
which the conductivity is extracted. For mixed compo-
sitions, we begin with a 20 ps equilibration in the NpT
ensemble, followed by a 200 ps NpT simulation during
which 100 Monte Carlo (MC) swaps between Br and Cl
atoms are attempted every 100 fs.
Fig. S3 in the SI
shows the number of accepted swaps along trajectories
of Li3YClBr in the C2/m and P¯3m1 phases at different
compositions, showing that the acceptance is around 12%
for the whole simulations. In order to extract the conduc-
tivity, we select four snapshots spaced 50 ps apart from
the NpT simulations with MC swaps; each snapshot is
then equilibrated for 50 ps in the NpT ensemble, followed
by a 3 ns production run for conductivity evaluation. All
simulations were performed at ambient pressure and at a
temperature of 300 K, consistent with the experimental
conditions we use as reference.
III.
RESULTS
A.
Validation of the potential
We validate the bespoke potential trained for the SSEs
on its test set, and compare the results with those from
the universal potential. The zero-shot application of the
PET-MAD already shows a good accuracy, in particular
a RMSE of 17.34 meV/atom or energy and 86.29 meV/˚A
for forces, corresponding to an 8% of the force standard
deviation in the test set. After the fine-tuning procedure,
the error is reduced even further, with an RMSE of 1.38
meV/atom for energy and 39.16 meV/˚A for forces, cor-
responding to 3.6% relative to the force standard devia-
tion. Fig. S1 of the Supplementary Information contains
the corresponding parity plots.
B.
Phase stability
We assess the stability of the P¯3m1 and C2/m struc-
tures upon doping.
To this end, we quenched the
snapshots we obtained from MC sampling, optimizing
their geometry using both PET-MAD and the fine-
tuned potentials.

P¯3m1, C2/m and x ∈0, 1 is the concentration of Cl
in the halide sites. To evaluate these energies, we used
the final snapshots from the 3 ns NpT production runs,
then we relaxed each structure by minimizing the atomic
forces, and then computed the corresponding formation
energies. For mixed compositions, the results shown in
the figure are obtained by averaging the formation ener-
gies of the 4 snapshots extracted from the MC simulation,
while the shaded area is the semi-dispersion of the four
results.
As shown in Fig. 1, the different snapshots have ener-
gies that differ slightly, but the relative stability of the
two phases follows clear trends, that are consistent be-
tween ML models and DFT reference. Both the zero-shot
and fine-tuned models predict the C2/m phase to be more
stable in the Br-rich part of the phase diagram, in agree-
ment with experimental observations. The crossover is
predicted to occur around 1:1 halide content, which is
also consistent with experimental observations.
PET-
MAD predicts a small positive mixing enthalpy for the
C2/m phase, and a small negative mixing enthalpy for
the P¯3m1 phase. The fine-tuned model, instead, yields
a positive mixing enthalpy for both phases. Comparison
with single-point DFT calculations for the structure opti-
mized with the fine-tuned model shows that – as expected
– fine-tuning does improve the accuracy of the model.
All sets of calculations are consistent with perfect mis-
cibility at room temperature, as even in the case of the
fine-tuned model, the positive mixing enthalpy is much
smaller than the ideal solution entropy (that amounts to
10.8 meV/atom at 300 K for x = 0.5, see grey dotted line

in Fig. 1). As we shall see below, this is consistent with an
analysis of the finite-temperature MC/MD, which shows
that the halides are randomly distributed in the alloy.
C.
Structural effects of halide alloying
Experimental evidence shows that variations in the
halide composition of SSEs affect their main structural
features13. However, little is known about the spatial dis-
tribution of halogen atoms within these materials, specif-
ically, whether they tend to cluster or remain randomly
dispersed9. One way to assess the presence of short-range
order in these alloys is to look at the composition of the
octahedral units. In a random alloy, the number of Cl/Br
anions in each octahedron should follow a binomial dis-
tribution depending on the overall composition, and any
deviation would indicate the presence of correlations. We
sample structures along the trajectories of the NpT sim-
ulations, where the MC swaps are attempted for both the
P¯3m1 (first column) and C2/m (second column) struc-
tures, skipping the first 10 ps for equilibration. The re-
sults of Fig. 2 show perfect agreement between the his-
togram extracted from the simulations and the theoreti-
cal results, confirming that the distribution of the halides
is random.
Another way to assess structural correlations is to an-
alyze the radial distribution function (RDF). Figure 3
presents the partial RDFs for a system of Li3YBr3Cl3
with the P¯3m1 (left) and C2/m (right) cell with both
PET-MAD and the finetuned model.

mentary information) revels that all partial halide-halide
RDFs exhibit similar behaviors. This indicates that Br
and Cl atoms are randomly distributed with no prefer-
ence for clustering at the level of individual YX6 units,
although differences in height of the first peak suggest a
slight preference for Cl atoms being located at opposing
corners of the octahedron. The zero-shot and fine-tuned
models show almost perfect agreement, underscoring the
high accuracy of the PET-MAD universal model.
The radial distribution functions can also help quantify
the impact of alloying on the structural parameters. The
bond length between the central metal atom in the octa-
hedral site and the halogen atoms at its vertices remains
nearly constant across different compositions.
During
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, each structure re-
laxes to an average Y–Cl distance of 2.65 ˚A, and an av-
erage Y–Br distance of 2.74 ˚A. Conversely, the volume
per formula unit decreases with increasing Cl content for
both phases (see Fig. 4). This contraction is also reflected
in the Y–Y RDF peaks, which show that a higher Cl con-
centration reduces Y–Y distances, increasing the packing
of the octahedra.
D.
Effects of alloying on the conductivity
We then move to consider the effect of alloying on the
conductivity, performing simulations in the isothermal-
isobaric ensemble, at ambient pressure and T = 300 K.
Given that within the comparatively short time sampled
by our simulations both the P¯3m1 and C2/m phases are
metastable across the full range of compositions, we per-
form simulations in both phases and at all concentrations.
Fig. 5 shows the result of our simulations compared to
the experimental results of Liu et al. 13 and van der Maas
et al. 12, that (as we discussed in the introduction) are
not fully consistent with each other. In Fig. 5, the green
points for Li3YBr6 and Li3YCl6 reported in Ref. 13 are
the same conductivities obtained by Asano et al. 8. The
results obtained with the zero-shot PET-MAD universal
potential (blue) and the fine-tuned model (pink) are in
qualitative agreement with each other. The conductiv-
ity is overestimated by about 1 order of magnitude. The
C2/m phase shows a near-monotonic increase of σ with
increasing Cl content, while the P¯3m1 has a maximum
around 1:1 alloying. Considering the experimental (and
theoretical) stability, this is consistent with the observa-
tion by Liu et al. 13 that the best performance can be
achieved with ≈50% doping. Despite the large overes-
timation of σ, our results predict an increase in σ also
for the C2/m phase, which corroborates the experimen-
tal observations in Ref. 13, and not those in Ref. 12, that
show a decreasing conductivity upon doping of Li3YBr
with Cl.
Another important observation from Fig. 5 is the vari-
ability in conductivity arising from disorder in the halo-
gen distribution. The conductivity of the four snapshots,
taken from one another, can differ by as much as 20%.
Given the small energy differences among the various
halogen configurations shown in Fig. 1, it is likely that
all of them can form under typical synthesis conditions,
such as ball milling or hot pressing8,12,13,72, resulting in
real materials that represent an average of these config-
urations. In light of the qualitative discrepancy between
experimental observations, and the large absolute shift
in σ between measurements and theory, it is clear that
the most important contribution that can come from our
simulations is to reveal qualitative insights – e.g. they
seem to support a maximum in σ around 1:1 alloy com-
position, in agreement with Liu et al. 13. Given that in
all our tests PET-MAD delivered qualitative behavior
consistent with that of the fine-tuned model, we use the
zero-shot universal model in the rest of our study, as it
allows us to explore larger distortions and a wider portion
of chemical space with no additional training cost.
E.
Decoupling the volume and chemical
composition dependence of the conductivity
The analysis performed in Section III C indicates that
the main structural effect of alloying (besides modulat-
ing the stability of different phases) is to tune the metal-
halide distance and the lattice parameters. To investigate
the impact of these structural changes on the conductiv-
ity of the halide-based SSE, we conduct two computa-
tional experiments. To study the effects of the volume,
we considered one of the 50% Cl 50% Br structures, and

ps followed by a 3 ns NVT simulation to compute σ.
Fig. 6 shows that the ionic conductivity is highly depen-
dent on the volume for both structures, increasing the
volume by around 5% increases σ by a factor of 2. The
potential predicts that the P¯3m1 phase has a higher con-
ductivity at almost all volumes. Given that increasing
Cl concentration decreases the molar volume, this effect
explains why Li3YCl6 has a sharp increase of σ upon
alloying with Br.
We also perform the complementary experiment,
studying the impact of the different chemical composi-
tions on the conductivity independently from the volume
effects. We fix the volume to that of the experimental
structure in Ref.13 for the Li3YCl3Br3 composition, then
we sweep the different degrees of alloying, from full Br
to full Cl substitution.
Following the same procedure
described in the previous section for the mixed composi-
tion: we performed a MC swap simulation in the NVT
environment, from which 4 snapshots have been selected
and then used to perform separate NVT simulations (one
short equilibration of 50 ps followed by a production run
of 3 ns). The maximum of the conductivity is achieved
for a composition around 75% of Cl with an average con-
ductivity that is around 8 times that obtained for the
pure Br structure (Fig. 6).
In the Br-rich part of the composition space, the two
effects compensate each other, explaining why the net ef-
fect observed in the NpT calculations (Fig. 4) is that of

increasing values of σ up to 50-75% Cl content, despite
the reduction in molar volume that - alone - would reduce
Li mobility. An interpretation of this compensation can
be attempted based on the structural analyisis in Sec-
tion III C: (1) Increasing the Cl content also leads to a
contraction of the octahedral framework (as evidenced
by the Y–Y peak shift in Fig. 4), thereby reducing Li-ion
mobility; (2) However, the presence of Cl, which forms
shorter Y–Cl bonds, facilitates faster Li-ion migration.
These insights provide valuable design principles for op-
timizing halide-based SSEs: achieving high conductivity
requires balancing Cl concentration, which promotes Li
diffusion, with maintaining a sufficiently large cell volume
and stabilizing the P¯3m1 structure.

INDIUM-YTTRIUM EXCHANGE
In the sections above, we have focused on the effects of
halogen alloying on structure and conductivity. On the
other hand, in solid-state electrolytes the use of metal
alloying73–75 also proved to be an effective method to
change the properties of the material. The use of a uni-
versal model, such as PET-MAD, that proved qualita-
tively accurate against a dedicated fine-tuned model, al-
lows us to easily study the effect of alloying the metal
ion. Li3InCl6 is a common halide SSE and is also found
in the C2m structure76. Starting from the structure in
Sec. III D, we substitute the Y atoms with In and follow
the same procedure presented in the previous sections to
study the effects of halogen substitutions. Fig. 8 shows
the behavior of Li3InBr6(1–x)Cl6x compared to the same
behavior of Li3YBr6(1–x)Cl6x from Fig. 5, which is quali-
tatively very similar. The P¯3m1 structure has higher con-
ductivity, and for 1:1 halogen doping, reaches the highest

value we observe.
The C2/m phase has a lower con-
ductivity, which increases almost monotonically in the
Br→Cl direction. As in the previous section our results
can give important qualitative insights, even though they
overestimate the conductivity of available experimental
data, e.g. for Li3InCl6 σ is in the [0.6 −2.4] × 10−1 S/m
range depending on processing conditions 72,76–78.
We then compare constant-volume and constant-
pressure simulations for varying metal composition
(Fig. 9). We fix the halide composition to a 1:1 ratio,
select a single realization of the halide ordering and – for
all intermediate Y-In compositions – perform an initial
MC sampling of the metal ion positions and generate four
initial configurations, that are used to perform indepen-
dent trajectories to estimate σ. Note that this protocol
means that Fig. 9 can show small inconsistencies with
Fig. 8, that averages over four halide configurations. Es-
pecially for the P¯3m1 phase, there is a substantial in-
terplay between volume and chemical effects, with a very
large increase of conductivity with In content predicted at
constant volume, but a much smaller variation observed
when simulating at constant pressure. Overall, we find a
small increase of σ for the C2/m phase, with a maximum
at 25% In content, while the P¯3m1 phase shows high
conductivity for pure Li3InCl3Br3 and Li3YCl3Br3, and
lower conductivity at all intermediate concentrations.

CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrates the enormous potential of
generally-applicable machine-learning potentials for the
study of complex functional materials, and provides some
mechanistic insights into the interplay between structure
and composition for halide-based solid-state electrolytes.
The PET-MAD potential we use shows semi-quantitative
agreement for both stability and charge transport in
Li3YCl6xBr6(1–x) alloys with a more accurate model that
is fine-tuned for this specific system. Both models indi-
cate that the C2/m form is more stable for the Br-rich
part of the phase diagram, with the P¯3m1 polymorph be-
ing more stable at high Cl concentrations, which is con-
sistent with experimental observations. They also concur
on predicting perfect miscibility of the two halides, and
on the effectively random distribution of the ions, that
show minimal indications of short-range ordering.
The conductivity is substantially overstimated com-
pared with experiments, but once again the zero-shot
model and the fine-tuned model are in qualitative agree-
ment, finding an increase in σ with Cl content for the
C2/m phase, and a maximum around the 1:1 compo-
sition for P¯3m1. These trends are consistent with Liu
et al. 79, which suggests that the decreasing conductiv-
ity seen in van der Maas et al. 12 might be indicative of
effects that go beyond bulk conductivity.
An important qualitative insight we can infer is how
halide substitution modulates conductivity through the
interplay of different effects. Besides controlling the sta-
bility of different polymorphs, substitution of Br with Cl
leads to a decrease in volume of the structure, which in
turns reduces σ. This effect is, however, compensated
by the contraction of the YX6 octahedra, which leaves
more space for Li diffusion despite the contraction of the
lattice. There is also significant variability in the values
of σ depending on the sampling of the halide disorder,
which makes it even more crucial to rely on MLIPs to be

8
able to simulate large supercells and to average several
configurations.
A similar interplay between molar volume and lo-
cal structure is seen when considering homovalent sub-
stitution of the metal ion.
The trends of σ for
Li3InCl6xBr6(1–x) are analogous to those seen in the Y
compound, while the mixed In/Y compounds show large
composition dependence of σ at constant volume, but
much weaker variability when simulating at the equilib-
rium density for each composition. Although there is a
significant quantitative discrepancy between simulations
and experiments, which can likely be attributed to a com-
bination of errors in the reference DFT method and limi-
tations in estimating conductivity for an ideal crystalline
bulk, our simulations suggest several design principles.
First, the 1:1 halide composition seems to yield high val-
ues of σ across different polymorphs and metal compo-
sitions. Second, the molar volume and the metal-halide
distances are important structural parameters that can
be determined in the pure compounds and used as guides
to test new alloys. Further exploration of the possible
metals substitutions might provide additional insights,
although the limited quantitative accuracy against the
experimental conductivity makes it desirable to also in-
vestigate the use of better electronic-structure references,
to facilitate predictive computational design of halide-
based solid-state electrolytes.

PARITY PLOT
Fig. S1 shows the parity plot for energy and forces of the PET-MAD universal potential (blue) and the finetuned
model (violet) computed for a test set. The figure also shows the root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) for both energies
and forces of both models. The RMSE is computed using these definitions:

where EML

The sum of t runs over all the Nset snapshots in the test set. F ML
tjα
and F DF T
tjα
represent the prediction of the α
component of the force acting on atom j in the snapshot t. Natoms represents the total number of atoms in all the
structures in the test set.
II.
SIZE SCALING
Fig. S2 shows conductivity as a function of the size of the system for the system of pure Br and Cl in both crystal
structures. The vertical dashed lines represent the size of 960 atoms, used in the main results of this work. At that
size the result is completely converged.
III.
MC STABILITY
Fig. S3 shows the evolution of the acceptance rate of Monte Carlo (MC) swaps during the simulation of
LiYBr6(1–x)Cl6x in the both phases at all the different compositions.
After an initial thermalization period, the
system reaches a stable number of accepted swaps, indicating equilibration. On average 12% of swaps-per-step are
accepted.

RADIAL DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION OF STRUCTURE OF DIFFERENT MC SIMULATION
Fig. S4 shows the partial radial distribution functions (RDFs) for the 4 configurations of Li3YBr3Cl3 in the P¯3m1
phase extracted from the MC simulation. The top panel shows the partial RDFs of the halogen atoms, while the
lower panel shows the RDF between the Y and the halogen atoms. In all cases the RDFs for different snapshot are
perfectly on top of each other, showing that different snapshots extracted from the MC simulations have the same
structure.

EFFECTS OF ALLOYING ON THE CONDUCTIVITY
In the main text we show the effects of alloying on the conductivity showing, in the cases of mixed composition,
the average conductivity of different snapshot at the same Br-Cl ratio. Fig. S5 is the equivalent of Fig. 5 in the main
text, where for the mixed compositions each point correspond to the σ extracted from a simulation done with one of
the structures selected from the MC simulation.
