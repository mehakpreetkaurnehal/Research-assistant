Abstract
This position paper delves into the transformative role of Geometric
Algebra (GA) in advancing specific areas of Computer Graphics
(CG) and Extended Reality (XR), particularly in character anima-
tion, rendering, rigging, neural rendering, and generative AI-driven
scene editing. Common CG algorithms require handling rotations,
translations, and dilations (uniform scalings) in operations such
as object rendering, rigged model animation, soft-body deforma-
tion, and XR simulations. Traditional representation forms—such as
matrices, quaternions, and vectors—often introduce limitations in
precision and performance. Recent breakthroughs in the use of GA
suggest it can significantly enhance these processes by encapsulat-
ing geometric forms and transformations into uniform algebraic
expressions, which maintain critical geometric properties through-
out multi-step transformations. Furthermore, we explore how GA
can serve as a unifying mathematical substrate for neurosymbolic
XR scene authoring, bridging learned neural representations and
explicit geometric reasoning. This paper outlines how GA-based
approaches can improve the fidelity of rigged character animations,
enhance soft-body simulations, streamline real-time rendering, and
optimize neural and generative AI scene editing. GA offers a co-
herent and efficient framework for these processes, resulting in
superior visual outcomes and computational efficiency, particularly
in XR environments.

Introduction
The field of Computer Graphics (CG) has historically relied on
a fragmented collection of mathematical algebras and geometri-
cal systems to represent and manipulate 3D objects, scenes and
transformations. Developers routinely switch between vectors for

position, matrices for linear transformations, and quaternions or
dual-quaternions for handling rotations to avoid issues like gimbal
lock. While each of these formalisms is powerful in its specific
domain, their coexistence within a single pipeline necessitates con-
stant, computationally expensive conversions. This fragmentation
not only introduces performance overhead and potential for nu-
merical instability but also creates a conceptual disconnect and
lack of intuition: the underlying geometry is often obscured by
the disparate algebraic representations. For example, Euler angles
provide an intuitive description of rotations, whereas quaternions,
though more robust computationally, obscure the geometric intu-
ition behind them.
This paper posits that Geometric Algebra (GA)—a Clifford Al-
gebra over the real numbers [4]—provides a comprehensive and
unified mathematical language capable of streamlining the entire
computer graphics pipeline—from modeling and animation to sim-
ulation, rendering, and interactive XR manipulation. GA offers a
single, intuitive framework where geometric entities (points, lines,
planes, spheres) and transformations (rotations, translations, di-
lations) are represented as uniform algebraic objects called mul-
tivectors. Our position is that by adopting GA, we can develop
algorithms that are not only more computationally efficient and nu-
merically robust, but also more geometrically intuitive. This unified
approach preserves the intrinsic meaning of geometric operations
throughout complex computations, leading to higher-fidelity results
in character simulation, interactive deformation, and generative
scene manipulation.
Our research program has demonstrated the practical benefits of
this position across several critical areas of CG and Extended Reality
(XR). We have developed novel algorithms for real-time mesh de-
formation, cutting, and tearing that leverage the expressive power
of GA to handle complex topological changes [11, 12]. Our award-
winning work in character animation has shown that GA-based
skinning and interpolation methods can reduce data transmission
in networked environments while improving animation quality
[9, 10]. These advances culminated in the introduction of GA-Unity,
the first Unity package that seamlessly integrates GA principles
into collaborative, networked applications. GA-Unity extends the
benefits of GA into practical 3D scene management and rendering,
offering an accessible interface for real-time multivector operations
that enhance both runtime efficiency and bandwidth usage in mul-
tiplayer scenarios. We have further validated these methods by
integrating them into a modern XR authoring platform, enabling
high-performance, artifact-free interactions in demanding applica-
tions such as surgical simulations [17, 18]. More recently, we are
extending this framework to the domain of generative AI, exploring
how GA can provide a structure-preserving latent space for intu-
itive, instruction-based scene manipulation with Large Language
Models (LLMs) [13].
This paper is structured to highlight this unified perspective
across the entire graphics pipeline. Section 2 introduces the core
principles of Geometric Algebra as a unified framework for geomet-
ric modeling. Subsequent sections describe its applications to mesh
manipulation, character animation [14], and networked XR envi-
ronments, including the GA-Unity framework as a key integration
layer for real-time deployment. Figure 1 provides a visual summary
of this vision, illustrating how GA can serve as a unified substrate
for the entire modern graphics pipeline, a concept we will detail in
the following sections. Finally, we synthesize these directions to
outline the emerging vision of GA as a foundational language for
geometry, simulation, and intelligence in computer graphics.
2
Geometric Algebra as a Unified Framework
for Computer Graphics
At its core, GA extends familiar vector algebra with a new, invertible
product: the geometric product. For any two basis vectors u and
v, their geometric product uv is defined as the sum of their inner
(dot) and outer (wedge) products:
uv = u · v + u ∧v
The scalar part, u·v, captures metric information such as length and
angle, while the new entity, u∧v, is a bivector. A bivector represents
the oriented plane segment swept out by the two vectors. This sim-
ple addition is profound. By combining scalars, vectors, bivectors,
and higher-grade elements (trivectors for volume, etc.) into a single
algebraic structure, GA allows us to represent geometric objects
and the operations acting upon them in a unified manner.
Building upon this foundation, the 3D Euclidean Geometric Al-
gebra (EGA), denoted as R3, provides the fundamental model for
representing points, lines, planes, and rotations in ordinary three-
dimensional space. It consists of three orthogonal basis vectors e1,
e2, and e3, together with all their outer products, yielding 23 = 8 ba-
sis elements in total. EGA thus spans scalars, vectors, bivectors, and
a trivector, enabling a compact and intuitive encoding of geometric
entities and operations. Rotations, for example, are naturally repre-
sented by rotors— multivectors that generalize quaternion-based
rotations without losing geometric clarity. More interested readers
may consult [2, 5, 6] for comprehensive treatments of Geometric
Algebra and its applications.
Extending further, the Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) has
emerged as a particularly powerful model for computer graphics.
CGA, the geometric algebra of R4,1,0, unifies rigid-body transfor-
mations (rotations and translations) as operations within a single
algebraic structure, and represents points, spheres, and planes in
3D space as 5D vectors (null vectors of the algebra). The notation
R4,1,0 indicates four positive, one negative, and zero null dimensions
in the metric signature. The resulting 5D conformal model arises
by extending the 3D Euclidean basis with two additional vectors,
e0 and e∞, corresponding respectively to the origin and the point
at infinity. Although the conformal basis is five-dimensional, the
complete algebra contains 25 = 32 elements, as all possible outer-
product combinations of the basis vectors are included. Rotations,
translations, and dilations are all represented by special multivec-
tors (called rotors, translators, and dilators) that act on geometric
objects through the “sandwich” product:
Objecttransformed = 𝑀· Objectoriginal · 𝑀−1
where 𝑀is the multivector representing the transformation.
This structure allows GA to generalize and subsume other alge-
braic systems used in computer graphics. Quaternions, for instance,
are isomorphic to the bivectors in 3D Euclidean GA, and dual-
quaternions find their natural home within the even subalgebra of
3D Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA) or CGA [12]. This means

One algebra for all : Geometric Algebra methods for neurosymbolic XR scene authoring, animation and neural rendering
that any operation performed with quaternions or dual-quaternions
has a direct, and often more intuitive, counterpart in GA.
The fundamental property that makes GA so powerful is that
geometry is preserved through algebraic manipulation. When we
compose transformations by multiplying their corresponding mul-
tivectors (𝑀composite = 𝑀2𝑀1), the resulting multivector 𝑀composite
correctly represents the composite geometric transformation. When
we interpolate between two transformations by linearly interpo-
lating their multivectors, the result is a geometrically meaningful
intermediate transformation [8, 9]. This is not true for matrices
where, for example, interpolating two rotation matrices does not
generally yield another rotation matrix. This property simplifies CG
pipelines immensely, eliminating the need for special interpolation
schemes like SLERP for quaternions and removing the conceptual
clutter of managing multiple, incompatible mathematical represen-
tations.
Beyond its theoretical elegance, GA’s unifying capability now ex-
tends into practical deployment. The recently introduced GA-Unity
framework [10] operationalizes these principles within the Unity
game engine, offering a modular environment where multivector-
based transformations are computed natively. The relationship
among these representation forms and their seamless transmutation
into GA equivalents is illustrated in Figure 9, where GA-Unity facil-
itates conversion between conventional transformation representa-
tions (vectors, matrices, quaternions) and their geometric-algebraic
counterparts within modern game engines. By enabling automatic
conversion between GA objects and standard engine constructs,
GA-Unity bridges the gap between mathematical abstraction and
real-time implementation. It supports efficient interpolation, defor-
mation, and scene manipulation in collaborative, networked appli-
cations, demonstrating that the benefits of GA are not confined to
theoretical rigor but translate directly into measurable performance
gains and development efficiency within contemporary 3D engines.

Applications in Geometry Processing and
Mesh Manipulation
One of the most compelling demonstrations of Geometric Algebra’s
power is in the domain of real-time geometry processing and 3D
mesh manipulation. Traditional methods for simulating deformable
objects or performing interactive mesh modifications like cutting,
tearing, and drilling often rely on complex data structures (e.g.,
tetrahedral meshes) and computationally intensive methods like
the Finite Element Method (FEM). These approaches frequently
require heavy pre-processing and struggle to maintain interactive
frame rates, especially in immersive XR applications.
Our research has shown that CGA provides a remarkably com-
pact and efficient framework for these tasks [11, 12]. By represent-
ing vertices, planes, and spheres as uniform multivectors, we can
express complex geometric predicates and operations as simple
algebraic manipulations. For example, the intersection of a cutting
plane and a mesh edge can be determined directly through GA
products, simplifying the logic required for real-time cutting.
In our work [12], we introduced a unified geometric algorithm
to cut, tear, and drill deformable, rigged models. This framework
leverages CGA to perform these operations on-the-fly, even af-
ter the model has been animated, while robustly maintaining the
deformation topology. Unlike previous methods, our approach re-
quires minimal pre-processing and is “GA-ready,” meaning all sub-
predicates are implemented in terms of multivector operations.
This unified approach yields algorithms that are not only compact
but also achieve excellent numerical stability and topological ro-
bustness. For instance, during a cut operation, our method creates
new vertices along the intersection and instantly computes their
skinning weights using barycentric coordinates. This allows the
newly separated mesh parts to be further deformed and animated
smoothly and without artifacts. This ability to perform dynamic
topological changes on animated characters is crucial for realistic
surgical XR simulations and other interactive training applications
[18].
A core benefit of this GA-native approach is its radical simpli-
fication of geometric constraints. The algebra itself encodes the
geometric relationships, freeing developers from managing com-
plex conditional logic and data structures required by traditional
methods. This results in cleaner, more maintainable code and deliv-
ers real-time performance, essential for demanding interactive XR
environments.

Rigged Character Animation and Scene-Level
Transformations
Animating rigged characters is a cornerstone of modern CG. The
standard method, Linear Blend Skinning (LBS), is prone to well-
known artifacts like collapsing joints (“candy-wrapper” effect). In
contrast, Dual-Quaternion Skinning (DQS) largely solves many
of these issues, achieving superior volume preservation and more
realistic deformations by blending rigid-body transformations (ro-
tations and translations) directly, rather than matrices [14, 15]. De-
spite its advantages, DQS does not elegantly handle non-uniform
scaling, a common requirement for stylized animation.
Geometric Algebra offers a natural and more powerful extension
to these techniques. As dual-quaternions can be represented within
GA, any DQS algorithm has a direct equivalent in a GA framework.
More importantly, GA provides a unified way to handle all affine
transformations, including scaling. In CGA, rotations, translations,
and dilations (i.e., uniform scalings) are all represented by multi-
vectors (rotors, translators, and dilators) that can be composed via
the geometric product.
Our research has leveraged this unified handling of transfor-
mations to improve both the fidelity and efficiency of deformable
character animation. In our award-winning work [9, 10], we devel-
oped a methodology for rigged character animation and deforma-
tion entirely within CGA. The standard skinning equation, which
blends transformations on a per-vertex basis, is translated into its
multivector equivalent. This allows us to apply a blend of rotations,
translations, and dilations in a single, coherent framework, using a
simple sandwich product to deform the vertices.

This approach not only simplifies the underlying mathematics
but also yields tangible performance and quality benefits. We have

demonstrated that linear interpolation of GA multivectors (motors)
produces smooth, artifact-free intermediate animation frames. This
capability is especially valuable for generating keyframes on-the-fly,
enabling high-fidelity motion that directly enhances the perceived
realism of the animation.
Beyond traditional animation, this same GA-based representa-
tion has proven highly effective for capturing, encoding, and re-
playing full-body motion in immersive environments. In our VR
Recorder and Replay system [8], user movements are captured as
GA multivectors, allowing each recorded session to be compactly
stored and later replayed with high geometric fidelity. By leveraging
GA’s compact and expressive representation, we can significantly
reduce the amount of stored motion data, while maintaining in-
terpolation accuracy comparable to standard representations such
as Euler angles, vectors, or even dual-quaternions (see Figure 3).
This capacity to capture and reproduce motion precisely further
validates GA’s versatility as a unified mathematical foundation for
the graphics pipeline.

Networked and Collaborative XR
Environments
The demands of real-time, multi-user XR applications place a sig-
nificant strain on network bandwidth. In a collaborative virtual
environment, the position, orientation, and scale of every user-
controlled object and avatar must be continuously synchronized
across all clients. Transmitting full transformation matrices (16
floats) for every update is inefficient and can lead to high latency,
which breaks the sense of shared presence and immersion.
This representational efficiency provides a clear and measurable
advantage in networked environments, acritical factor for real-time
XR. A rigid-body transformation (rotation and translation) repre-
sented using a GA multivector (a “motor” in Projective or Conformal
GA) is far more compact than a 4x4 matrix. For example, a motor
in 3D PGA requires only 8 floats, equivalent to a dual-quaternion.
Leveraging this compactness significantly reduces data payload
that must be transmitted over the network for each transformation
update.
Our research, detailed in [8, 9], validates this approach exper-
imentally. We implemented a shared VR system where transfor-
mation data for objects and hand-controllers are encoded as GA
multivectors before transmission. Critically, the client side receives
these compact multivectors and used them to locally interpolate
intermediate frames. This GA-based pipeline reduced the required
network bandwidth by up to 58% compared to traditional vectors
and quaternion-based methds, while achieving an equivalent or
superior Quality of Experience (QoE).
This efficiency comes from the power of multivector interpola-
tion. Because interpolating between two GA motors yields a geomet-
rically meaningful results, we can send fewer keyframe updates per
second and rely on the client to generate smooth, jitter-less motion
locally. This is particularly effective in bandwidth-restricted cases;
for instance, our GA-based method can achieve a visual quality 30
updates/sec with a traditional approach using only 20 updates/sec

tive XR experiences to include more users and dynamic objects,
establishing it as a key enabling technology for multiplayer gam-
ing, remote collaboration, and shared educational simulations (see

at SIGGRAPH 2022 [7].

From Geometry to Intelligence: GA in Neural
and Generative Graphics
The recent explosion of generative AI and Large Language Models
(LLMs) has opened new frontiers for content creation and scene
manipulation. The ability to edit a 3D scene using natural language
instructions—“move the chair to the right of the table”—is a para-
digm shift for artists, designers, and everyday users. However, a
fundamental challenge remains: bridging the gap between the se-
mantic, often ambiguous, nature of human language and the precise,
mathematical descriptions required by a graphics engine. Current
methods often rely on machine learning models that operate on
unstructured representations like pixels or voxels (e.g., NeRFs CITE
NEEDED), which makes precise, object-level manipulation difficult.
We propose that Geometric Algebra can serve as the ideal structure-
preserving latent space for AI-driven graphics. Because GA multi-
vectors encode both geometric entities and their spatial relation-
ships within a single algebraic framework, they provide a perfect
symbolic language for an AI to reason about a 3D scene. An LLM’s
task is simplified from generating raw coordinate data to generating
the correct algebraic operators (GA multivectors) that achieve the
desired transformation.
Our current research on LLM-based scene manipulation, “Shen-
long” [13], demostrates this GA-AI integration. The system lever-
ages an LLM to interpret a user’s natural language command, with
a crucial distinction: the LLM’s role is not to generate code or vertex
positions, but to translate user intent into a precise CGA expres-
sion. For example, the instruction “place object A on top of object
B” causes the LLM to construct a CGA expression. This epression,
when executed, resolves to a CGA translator multivector that com-
putes the necessary displacement based on the objects’ bounding
boxes. This final CGA motor is then applied directly to the object’s
transformation component in the scene graph.
This GA-centric approach has several advantages. First, it lever-
ages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs, elim-
inating the need for massive, scene-specific training datasets. Sec-
ond, it ensures geometric precision, as the final transformation is a
mathematically exact GA operation, not a probabilistic approxima-
tion. Our preliminary results (see Figure 7) validate this method,
showing that it significantly outperforms baselines by reducing
LLM response times and boosting success rates on complex spatial
queries.
This GA-AI synergy extends beyond high-level logic and into
the core rendering pipeline. Our recent work on “Neural-GASh”
[6] introduces a novel real-time shading architecture based on
a neural radiance field. This approach, which utilized an initial
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model (see Figure 5), outperforms

Kamarianakis, Protopsalts, Papagiannakis
traditional Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) methods. The
key advantage is that our model is trained to directly consume
CGA representations of vertex positions and normals, completely
eliminating the expensive, static pre-computation step required by
PRT. This enables high-fidelity, dynamic shading of fully animated
meshes in real-time (see Figure 6). The framework’s robustness is
further demonstrated by its ability to shade scenes generated via 3D
Gaussian Splatting, proving its flexibility beyond traditional mesh-
based geometry (see Figure 8). Furthermore, preliminary results
from a new GNN-based extension of this method show even greater
fidelity, as the GNN architecture better captures mesh topology to
yield superior results in complex self-shadowing scenarios. This
architectural progression provides a concrete validation for the new
class of geometrically-aware neural architectures we propose.
Looking forward, we envision a new class of GA-embedded neu-
ral architectures. These models would not merely learn pixel corre-
lations but would be structured to inherently understand geometric
meaning. By training models to operate directly on multivector
representations, we can create generative-AI systems that respect
geometric constraints, understand symmetry, and can perform com-
plex spatial reasoning, currently out of reach for purely data-driven
approaches. This synergy between the symbolic precision of GA
and the learning power of neural networks defines a compelling
new frontier for intelligent graphics.

Integration into Modern XR Authoring
Platforms
A significant part of our research has focused on the practical val-
idation and integration of our GA-based methods into modern
XR authoring platforms. By primarily focusing on C# implemen-
tations within the Unity game engine, we bridge the gap between
theoretical advancements and production-ready tools. This focus
on implementation ensures that our algorithms can be readily ap-
plied in production environments for creating interactive and high-
performance applications.
We have successfully integrated our GA algorithms for mesh ma-
nipulation, character animation, and efficient network transmission
into a cohesive XR authoring platform [18]. This framework built
upon contemporary game engines, directly exposes our GA-based
functionalities to developers. Our ‘GA-Unity‘ package, for instance,
provides a streamlined workflow for developers to represent object
transformations as GA multivectors. It handles the conversion from
standard Unity formats (Vector3, Quaternion) to multivectors and
provides optimized interpolation functions essential for networked
applications [10]. Demonstrating significant performance improve-
ments over previous methods, this work was recognized with both
the Best Paper and the Best Application Award at the CGI 2024
ENGAGE Workshop.
Our platform has been used to build high-fidelity surgical simu-
lations where the real-time, artifact-free deformation, cutting, and
tearing of soft-body tissues is a critical requirement [12, 18]. In
these medical VR applications, the robustness and performance of
our GA algorithms allow for a level of realism and interactivity that
would be difficult to achieve with traditional methods. Similarly,
our framework has been used to create collaborative training and
educational tools (see Figure 3) where the efficient synchronization
of actions in a shared virtual environment is paramount [7, 16].
By packaging these advanced geometric methods into accessible
tools for platforms like Unity, we are lowering the barrier to entry
for developers. This simultaneously validates the performance and
utility of GA in a production context and accelerates the dissem-
ination of these powerful techniques into broader industry and
academic curricula, paving the way for wider adoption.

Unified Perspective and Outlook
The research presented in this paper establishes GA not as a mere
mathematical abstraction, but as a practical framework capable
of unifying and transforming many parts of the modern graphics
pipeline. Across multiple domains— mesh manipulation, character
animation, XR interaction, and generative scene editing—GA pro-
vides a single, coherent algebraic framework that supersedes the
traditional fragmented representations based on vectors, matrices,
and quaternions.
In mesh manipulation, GA allows us to encode vertices, edges,
faces, and local transformations as multivectors, enabling real-time
operations such as deformation, cutting, and tearing while preserv-
ing geometric coherence. Unlike conventional approaches that treat
rotation and translation separately, GA unifies these transforma-
tions, resulting in more robust and numerically stable algorithms.
This unified framework provides a foundation for techniques pre-
viously difficult or impossible to express compactly, while simul-
taneously reducing the computational overhead associated with
multiple converting between different algebraic forms.
GA extends this unification to character animation, replacing
specialized schemes like SLERP and dual quaternion interpolation.
By representing rotations, translations, and interpolations as multi-
vectors, we achieve geometrically meaningful blends using a single,
consistent algebraic tool. The integration of GA into networked
systems, as realized in our GA-Unity framework, directly enables
compressed pose transmission, reduces runtime, and ensures coher-
ent behavior across distributed simulations. This provides a tangible
improvement over traditional pipelines, demonstrating how GA
is able to transform not only the mathematical representation but
also the fundamental system-level architecture for interactive ap-
plications.
In XR and collaborative authoring contexts, GA provides a uni-
fying language for transformations, deformations, and interactions,
ensuring that scene updates, manipulations, and physics compu-
tations remain consistent across local and remote environments.
Our GA-Unity framework operationalizes these concepts within
modern game engines. It handles conversions between traditional
representations and their GA equivalents (Figure 9) while allowing
developers to leverage GA-based operations without modifying
existing rendering or simulation subsystems. This capability is es-
sential for enabling high-fidelity, multi-user XR experiences where
both geometric accuracy and performance are critical.
GA also extends naturally into neural and generative graph-
ics, where maintaining geometric fidelity in learned latent spaces
is a primary challenge. By structuring latent representations as
multivectors, we provide geometrically meaningful foundation for
instruction-driven scene editing with LLMs [13]. This integration

ensures that semantic instructions translate into valid transforma-
tions, enabling AI-assisted content creation that remains coherent
and interpretable, even in complex 3D environments.
This GA-AI integration is equally transformative in neural ren-
dering. Our "Neural-GASh" architecture [3] demonstrates this by
training a neural model to consume CGA representations directly as
input. This approach completely eliminates the static pre-computation
step of traditional PRT, enabling high-fidelity, dynamic shading of
fully animated and deformed meshes. This use of GA as a native
input for neural networks provides a concrete validation for a new
class of high-performance, geometrically-aware rendering and sim-
ulation architectures.

On Practical Adoption and Future Directions
A critical reader might ask: if GA’s benefits are this clear, why
has it not already superseded traditional methods? The answer
involves a combination of historical inertia, a narrow definition of
"performance," and a prior lack of production-ready tools.
Historically, the entire graphics ecosystem—from GPU hardware
to rendering APIs—has been aggressively optimized for 4x4 ma-
trix operations. This created a significant performance barrier for
alternative algebras. However, this "operation-level" performance
view is too narrow for modern, complex applications. As this paper
has demonstrated, the system-level benefits of GA are now proving
more significant. The massive reduction in network bandwidth
(Section 5) and the complete elimination of static pre-computation
in neural rendering (Section 6) represent performance gains that
far outweigh any micro-level cost of a multivector operation.
The primary barrier, therefore, has been one of usability and tool-
ing. The perceived learning curve of GA and the lack of integration
into standard engines have historically prevented widespread adop-
tion. Our work on GA-Unity (Section 7) was developed specifically
to solve this problem. By providing an accessible, high-performance
bridge that integrates GA-native operations directly into a main-
stream engine, we lower the barrier to entry, allowing developers
to leverage GA’s power without needing to be experts in the under-
lying algebra. As the demands of XR and generative AI continue
to push traditional fragmented tools past their limits, we believe
that practical, high-performance frameworks like GA-Unity finally
pave the way for GA’s wider adoption as the new standard.
Collectively, these contributions establish GA as a comprehen-
sive substrate for graphics computation: it not only replaces frag-
mented mathematical tools but also enables new algorithms and
tools that exploit its algebraic expressiveness. GA-Unity exempli-
fies this by bridging the theoretical advantages of GA with prac-
tical implementation in modern engines, empowering developers
and researchers to create interactive, networked, and generative
graphics pipelines that were previously difficult to realize. Figure 1
summarizes this vision, illustrating how GA permeates the full
pipeline—from geometry definition to physics-based animation,

tion—providing a single unifying framework that elevates both the
efficiency and the expressive power of modern graphics systems.
In summary, Geometric Algebra is not only an elegant mathe-
matical framework but also a practical catalyst for innovation in

computer graphics and XR. By preserving geometry across trans-
formations, reducing redundancy, and enabling coherent multi-
domain operations, GA augments existing pipelines and facilitates
the creation of new techniques and tools that fully exploit the po-
tential of a unified algebraic representation. This positions GA as a
next-generation foundation for graphics, interactive systems, and
generative environments alike.
While our work demonstrates production-level performance by
minimizing overhead, the ultimate step is to challenge the hardware-
level inertia directly. The industry’s reliance on 4x4 matrices is an
optimization for a legacy paradigm. The emergence of GA-based,
matrix-free implementations, such as the one presented in [1],
marks the beginning of this transition. In that work, GA operations
were executed directly within vertex and fragment shaders, achiev-
ing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art matrix-based
pipelines. These findings suggest that a paradigm shift is both fea-
sible and beneficial. We therefore propose that future GPU and
CPU architectures should explore GA-native hardware accelera-
tion. Just as modern GPUs now include “RT Cores” for ray tracing
and “Tensor Cores” for AI, a “GA Core” that natively accelerates
multivector operations—such as the sandwich product and mo-
tor interpolation—could unlock orders-of-magnitude performance
gains. This would render the entire "performance" debate obsolete
and position GA as the undisputed substrate for all real-time spatial
computation.
Finally, the truest adoption will come from standardization. While
GA-Unity serves as a robust proof-of-concept, the community must
move toward a standardized, open-source, and highly-optimized
library for GA computation, analogous to “GLM” for linear algebra.
This would provide a common foundation for a new generation of
fully-unified engines where graphics, computational physics, and
AI are not separate subsystems, but rather different applications
of the same, single geometric algebra. This ’grand unification’ of
all spatial computation remains the ultimate promise of GA, a goal
that our work demonstrates is not only possible, but practical.
