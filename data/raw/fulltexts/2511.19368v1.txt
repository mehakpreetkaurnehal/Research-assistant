Abstract—Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has
been increasingly adopted in many real-world applications.
While MARL enables decentralized deployment on resource-
constrained edge devices, it suffers from severe non-stationarity
due to the synchronous updates of agent policies. This non-
stationarity results in unstable training and poor policy con-
vergence, especially as the number of agents increases. In this
paper, we propose RELED, a scalable MARL framework that
integrates large language model (LLM)-driven expert demonstra-
tions with autonomous agent exploration. RELED incorporates a
Stationarity-Aware Expert Demonstration module, which lever-
ages theoretical non-stationarity bounds to enhance the quality
of LLM-generated expert trajectories, thus providing high-
reward and training-stable samples for each agent. Moreover,
a Hybrid Expert-Agent Policy Optimization module adaptively
balances each agent’s learning from both expert-generated and
agent-generated trajectories, accelerating policy convergence and
improving generalization. Extensive experiments with real city
networks based on OpenStreetMap demonstrate that RELED
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
MARL methods.

to execute complex tasks and achieve real-time interactions
has been substantially improved [1]–[11]. Multi-agent sys-
tems (MAS) have attracted increasing attention due to their
unique advantages in distributed collaboration and scalability.
Among various MAS paradigms, multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) has emerged as a prominent direction in
recent years [12], [13]. MARL leverages lightweight neural
networks as policy functions for each agent, markedly reduc-
ing inference overhead and latency, and thus facilitating de-
ployment on resource-constrained edge devices [14]. Further-
more, MARL typically employs centralized value estimation
for joint policy optimization during training, while enabling
decentralized decision-making based on local observations
during inference [15]. This paradigm effectively achieves low-
latency responses and minimizes inter-agent communication
overhead, leading to its successful application in domains such
as computation offloading [16]–[19], drone scheduling [20],
[21], and urban traffic management [22], [23].
Despite these advantages, MARL still faces significant non-
stationarity challenges [24]. Existing MARL training frame-
works can be broadly categorized into fully decentralized
frameworks [25], [26] and centralized training with decentral-
ized execution (CTDE) [27], [28]. In fully decentralized set-
tings, each agent optimizes its policy from local observations
and individual rewards. This independence ignores cross-agent
behavioral dependencies and results in policy conflicts that
degrade overall system performance. CTDE mitigates these
issues by using centralized value estimation during training
to promote cooperative behavior. Nevertheless, as the scale of
the multi-agent system increases, the joint state-action space
grows exponentially, leading to a dramatic increase in the
cost of policy evaluation and exacerbating estimation errors of
each agent’s action value [29]. The resulting bias often drives
agents toward homogenized policies, reducing behavioral di-
versity and hindering exploration of globally optimal solutions.
Fundamentally, these issues stem from learning-induced non-
stationarity. Each agent’s environment includes other agents
that are simultaneously updating their policies. Any update
by one agent alters the environment dynamics observed by
the others, violating the stationarity assumptions underlying
standard reinforcement learning algorithms [30].
Fortunately, large language models (LLMs) trained on ex-
tensive corpora have shown strong reasoning and decision-
making in complex settings [31]–[36], making them promising

tools for generating expert knowledge and demonstrations
to improve policy optimization in MARL. However, LLMs
operate from prompts and prior knowledge rather than direct
interaction with the environment, they offer limited exploration
and thus tend to recommend actions only for familiar or well-
specified states [37]. This reduces demonstration diversity and
state-space coverage, which in turn hampers policy gener-
alization to unvisited or poorly observed states in MARL.
Moreover, the quality of LLM-generated demonstrations is
highly dependent on the input context [38]. In partially observ-
able environments, where agents can only obtain incomplete
observations of the true state, LLM-generated demonstrations
tend to guide agents toward suboptimal behaviors, impeding
convergence to optimal policies.
To address these research gaps, we propose RELED, a scal-
able multi-agent policy optimization framework that integrates
LLM-driven expert demonstrations with agent autonomy.
Firstly, we develop a Stationarity-Aware Expert Demonstration
(SED) module in RELED based on LLMs, which quantifies
and theoretically bounds the environmental non-stationarity
induced by simultaneous multi-agent policy updates. Refined
by feedback metrics derived from our theoretical analysis,
the LLM in SED module generates targeted demonstration
results for each agent, aiming to maximize high cumula-
tive rewards while constraining non-stationarity. Secondly, we
develop a Hybrid Expert-Agent Policy Optimization (HPO)
module in RELED. In HPO module, each agent combines
LLM-generated demonstrations from the SED module with
its own autonomous exploration experiences by independently
optimizing a hybrid policy loss function. This hybrid policy
optimization approach not only accelerates policy convergence
but also mitigates the sample diversity and performance limita-
tions in purely LLM-generated demonstrations, thus improving
both learning efficiency and generalization for each agent. The
key contributions of this work are summarized as follows:
• We propose RELED, a scalable MARL framework that
couples LLM-based expert demonstrations with decen-
tralized exploration, achieving efficient training.
• We derive a performance bound with two computable
metrics, namely the reward volatility index and the policy
divergence index, to quantify non-stationarity.
• We propose a stationarity-aware LLM refinement mech-
anism, which uses the above metrics as feedback to
iteratively update instructions to generate high-quality
demonstrations.
• We propose a hybrid policy optimization mechanism that
transitions from imitation to exploration by adaptively
balancing the weights of expert and agent-generated
samples.
• We empirically evaluate RELED on real city networks
based on OpenStreetMap. The results demostrate that
RELED outperforms state-of-the-art MARL baselines.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
discusses related work. Section III presents the RELED frame-
work. Section IV describes the implementation of RELED.
Section V reports the evaluation results. Finally, Section VI
concludes the paper.
II. RELATED WORK
MARL has attracted significant attention for its ability to
address complex cooperative and competitive tasks involving
multiple agents [24]. A prominent category of MARL algo-
rithms is value-based methods, which estimate the expected
returns of joint actions through action-value functions (Q-
functions) and derive optimal joint policies accordingly [39]–
[41]. QMIX enhances decentralized policy learning in MARL
by employing mixing networks to combine individual agent
Q-values into a joint action-value function while maintaining
monotonicity [27]. Building on QMIX, HMDQN integrates
hierarchical reinforcement learning to mitigate sparse reward
challenges in multi-robot tasks [42]. Another key category
is policy-based methods, which directly optimize stochastic
policies represented as probability distributions over actions
conditioned on states [25], [43]. HATRPO extends trust re-
gion policy optimization to multi-agent scenarios, ensuring
stable and efficient collaborative learning through advantage
decomposition and sequential policy updates [44]. MACPO
incorporates safety constraints into MARL, ensuring agents
consistently satisfy constraints during policy updates via trust
region restrictions [45]. Other methods employing determin-
istic policies output actions directly rather than probability
distributions, improving policy robustness by leveraging global
information for centralized training [28], [46].
Recent advances in LLMs have broadened their knowledge
and reasoning abilities, leading to research on using LLMs
to improve the performance of single-agent reinforcement
learning [47]. Some studies focus on achieving effective rep-
resentation mapping between LLMs’ text-based input-output
and the RL environment’s state and action spaces [48], [49].
Qiu et al. [50] propose a multimodal vision-text framework
for aligning non-text observations with actions via joint fine-
tuning. LANCAR addresses ambiguous robotic locomotion
instructions by leveraging LLMs to generate context-aware
embeddings [51]. LLaRP uses frozen pre-trained LLMs with
learnable adapters to enable strong generalization in vision-
language policies [52]. Other studies have explored LLMs
for designing reward functions, addressing the limitations of
traditional hand-crafted rewards in terms of sparsity, bias, and
scalability [53], [54]. Kwon et al. proposed using LLMs as
proxy reward functions, allowing users to define RL objec-
tives with natural language prompts and few-shot examples,
thus reducing the need for expert demonstrations [55]. Song
et al. developed a self-optimizing reward framework where
LLMs iteratively generate and refine reward functions from
natural language instructions, replacing manual reward design
in continuous control tasks [56]. Several studies [57], [58] have
leveraged LLMs to enhance cooperation or improve sample
efficiency in MARL. However, leveraging LLMs to address
the non-stationarity bottleneck in MARL systems has received
little attention and remains an unexplored direction.

complish tasks in a shared environment while only receiving
partial local observations. As a result, MARL is formu-
lated as a decentralized partially observable Markov process
(Dec-POMDP) [59], which is formally defined by the tuple
⟨A, S, U, P, R, Ω, O, ρ0, γ⟩. Specifically, A = {1, . . . , n} rep-
resents the set of n agents, and S denotes the state space. The
joint action space is given by U = Qn
i=1 Ui, where Ui denotes
the action space of agent i. The state transition function
P : S ×U ×S →[0, 1] defines the probability of transitioning
to the next state given the current state and joint action. The
reward function R =

Ri	
i∈A, where Ri : S × U × S →R
assigns a reward to each agent. Ωdenotes the observation
space, and O =

Oi	
i∈A, with Oi : S × Ui →Ωas the
observation function for agent i. The initial state distribution
ρ0 : S →[0, 1] defines the probability of each initial state. The
discount factor γ ∈[0, 1] determines the relative importance
of future rewards.
Interaction Process and Agent Trajectory. In Dec-
POMDP, the policy πi
: Ω× Ui
→[0, 1] denotes the
probability distribution over actions for agent i. An episode
begins with the environment sampling an initial state s0 ∼ρ0.
At each time step t, agent i receives a local observation
oi
t ∈Ωaccording to its observation function Oi(st). Each
agent then selects an action ui

, forming the
joint action ut = (u1
t, . . . , un
t ). The environment transitions
to st+1 ∼P(· | st, ut) and provides each agent with a reward
ri
t = Ri(st, ut, st+1). The process continues, with each agent
receiving an observation-action-reward tuple at each time step,
which is formalized as follows:

B. System Overview
In this section, we propose RELED, a scalable policy
optimization framework that integrates LLM-driven expert
demonstrations with agent-driven autonomous exploration.
The framework consists of two key modules: an Stationarity-
Aware Expert Demonstration (SED) module and a Hybrid
Expert-Agent Policy Optimization (HPO) module, as outlined
below:
• To mitigate the intrinsic non-stationarity arising from
simultaneous policy updates in MARL systems, we pro-
pose the Stationarity-Aware Expert Demonstration (SED)
module (see Section III-D). Based on a theoretically
derived upper bound on environmental non-stationarity,
the SED module quantitatively estimates the impact of
policy changes and leverages LLMs to generate tar-
geted expert demonstration trajectories for each agent.
By incorporating both the reward volatility index and

4
the policy divergence index, which are derived from our
theoretical analysis, as feedback, the generated expert
demonstrations can effectively stabilize the environment
and accelerate policy convergence for all agents.
• To address the limited coverage of the state-action space
and the poor generalization associated with pure imitation
learning from expert demonstrations, we propose the
Hybrid Expert-Agent Policy Optimization (HPO) module
(see Section III-E). The HPO module separately evalu-
ates policy losses on both expert-generated and agent-
generated trajectories, and integrates them through a
dynamically adjusted weighting scheme. This adaptive
mechanism enables agents to gradually shift from expert-
driven imitation to autonomous exploration as training
progresses, accelerating policy convergence and mitigat-
ing suboptimal solutions.
As illustrated in Figure 1, during each iteration of expert
demonstration generation, the agent set A is randomly parti-
tioned into m disjoint subsets. Agents within each subset inter-
act with the environment by following instruction sequences
generated by the SED module, while the remaining agents
execute their current policies. Within the SED module, reward-
instruction and policy divergence-instruction pair sets are
constructed by analyzing the resulting trajectory sets. These
pair sets then provide feedback to the LLM, enabling iterative
refinement of the instruction sequences. The HPO module
adopts a fully decentralized training framework, where each
agent independently optimizes its policy by leveraging both its
own trajectories and those generated via instruction sequences.
The agent and expert advantages, Aa,i
t
and Ae,i
t , are computed
based on their respective value functions and are used to
define separate policy losses. An adaptive weighted fusion
mechanism dynamically adjusts the contributions of agent and
expert losses according to the similarity between agent and
expert trajectories, achieving hybrid policy optimization.
C. Theoretical Analysis of Non-Stationarity in MARL System
In this section, we present a theoretical analysis of envi-
ronmental non-stationarity in MARL systems, serving as the
foundation for the SED module.
A fundamental challenge in MARL arises from the in-
herent non-stationarity of the environment, induced by the
simultaneous policy updates of multiple agents. As each
agent updates its policy, the environment perceived by other
agents changes dynamically, leading to biased estimates of
its objective functions. This bias stems from the difficulty in
distinguishing whether reward fluctuations originate from an
agent’s own actions or from the evolving policies of other
agents. Therefore, it is essential to quantify the impact of
each agent’s policy changes on the value estimations of other
agents. Such quantification enables the targeted refinement of
LLM-generated expert demonstrations, thereby enhancing the
stability and performance of MARL systems.
However, directly assessing the impact of each agent’s
policy changes on the objectives of other agents results
in sample complexity and computational overhead growing
multiplicatively with the number of agents. To address this
problem, we partition the agent set A into m disjoint subsets
{A1, . . . , Am}, and focus on the joint objective function of
the other agents when the policies of agents within a specific
subset Aj are changed. Specifically, for a given subset of
agents Aj, we first define the joint objective of the external
agents as follows:
JA−j(π) =

i/∈Aj
Ji (π)

(4)
where A−j = A \ Aj denotes the external agents of subset
Aj, i.e., all agents not in Aj, and rA−j
t
= P
i/∈Aj ri
t denotes
the sum of rewards obtained by external agents of subset
Aj at time step t. We then derive the variation bounds of
the external agents’ objective function under different policy
configurations of an agent subset, thereby quantifying the
resulting environmental non-stationarity, as formalized in the
following theorem:
Theorem 1. (Performance Bound on Group-Level Non-
Stationarity) Consider two arbitrary sets of joint policies for
an agent subset Aj:

k∈Aj denotes the joint observation of the


πi | i ∈A \ Aj
	
denote the
set of policies for agents external to the subset Aj, and define
the joint policies bπ and eπ as:
bπ (· | ot) = bπAj 

performance-difference bounds, extend them to partially observable
multi-agent settings, and further derive a broader bound to facili-
tate subsequent estimation in practice. Specifically, we first assume
γf (s′) ≡f (s) in Theorem 1 of Achiam et al. [60], and extend it
to joint policies bπ and eπ, which yields:

. The-
orem 1 demonstrates that even minor deviations in individ-
ual agent policies can collectively exacerbate instability in
the objective functions of other agents. This highlights the
importance of controlling individual policy changes to ensure
stability in MARL systems.
Building on Theorem 1, we derive an immediate corollary
that bounds the agent-level non-stationarity.
Corollary 1. (Performance Bound on Agent-Level Non-
Stationarity) Consider two arbitrary policies bπi and eπi for
agent i, and a policy sets for A \ { i}:

Proof. The result follows from Theorem 1 by setting Aj =
{i}.
Remark. Corollary 1 establishes an upper bound on the
impact of an agent’s policy change on the objective func-
tions of other agents. However, applying this upper bound
necessitates individual evaluation for each agent, resulting
in a total of n estimations and a computational complexity
that scales linearly with the number of agents. In contrast,
Theorem 1 introduces a subset-based bound, reducing the
required evaluations to m. Therefore, the bound estimation
based on Theorem 1 reduces computational cost and thus is
more scalable and practical for MARL systems.
D. Stationarity-Aware Expert Demonstration Module
In this section, we propose the SED module, which lever-
ages LLMs to generate expert demonstrations for each agent.
The SED module incorporates both the reward volatility index
and the policy divergence index, derived from the theoretical
results in Section III-C, as feedback to iteratively query LLMs
for demonstrations with high expected returns and enhanced
environmental stability.
Conventional expert demonstrations for MARL typically
relies on rule-crafted or human-curated demonstrations [61],
[62], which are costly to obtain and tailored to specific task
scenarios. In contrast, LLMs, with their strong contextual rea-
soning capabilities and extensive prior knowledge, have shown
great potential in generating customized expert demonstrations
for MARL agents [63], [64]. Furthermore, by continuously
providing environmental feedback to the LLM, the generated
demonstrations can be dynamically adapted for each agent,
thereby producing high-quality demonstration samples and
further accelerating the convergence of agent policies.
Therefore, we employ an LLM-driven expert demonstration
generation mechanism in the SED module. For clarity, we
denote the LLM as Π (d), where d is the prompt input. The
objective of the LLM is to generate an instruction sequence
for each agent, formalized as E =

ei
k | i ∈A, k = 0, 1, . . .
	
.
Each instruction sequence ei comprises ordered task steps
that guide agent i to interact with the environment. To ensure

6
executability, each instruction ei
j is selected from a predefined
set C. The environment then maps each instruction to an exe-
cutable action sequence via an execution function f : C →Ul,
defined as:
f
 ei
k

=

ui
tk, ui
tk+1, . . . , ui
tk+li
k−1

(15)
where 0
<
li
k
≤
l denotes the number of timesteps
required for agent i to complete instruction ei
k. In im-
plementation, f
corresponds to a set of programmatic
functions
that
realize
the
semantics
of
instructions
in
C. For example, in vehicle routing, an instruction such
as move_to_by_shortest_path(node_id) is opera-
tionalized by invoking a function that directs the agent to the
specified node via the shortest path. Further implementation
details are provided in Section IV.
In Theorem 1, we quantitatively characterize the impact
of policy changes within a subset of agents on the objective
functions of other agents. This provides a theoretical bound
for analyzing the non-stationarity induced in the environ-
ment when that subset updates its policy by imitating expert
demonstrations. Accordingly, the SED module employs the
reward volatility index and policy divergence index, both
derived from this bound, as two feedback metrics for the
LLM. Specifically, let eπ and bπ denote the joint policies
of the agent subset Aj before and after the update, re-
spectively. By minimizing the upper bound established in
Theorem 1, the SED module constrains the fluctuations in
the objective functions of external agents caused by policy
shifts within Aj. To this end, during each iteration, the SED
module randomly partitions the agent set A into m disjoint
subsets {A1, . . . , Am} to comprehensively evaluate the non-
stationarity induced by different agent combinations. For each
subset Aj, agents in the subset selects actions according to
the instruction sequence EAj =

ei | i ∈Aj, k = 0, 1, . . .
	
generated by the LLM, executed via function f, while the
remaining agents follow their respective policies. All agents
interact with the environment to generate the trajectory set bτ,
formalized as:
bτ = τ e,j ∼Env
 EAj, πA−j | s0, P, f

,
(16)
where πA−j = Q
i/∈Ajπi denotes the joint policy of agents
outside Aj. For comparison, the agent trajectory set eτ is ob-
tained via rollout under the current joint policy (i.e., eτ = τ a).
To minimize the reward volatility index, expert demonstra-
tions should ensure that updating the policy of the agent subset
Aj results in a decrease in the reward fluctuations of external
agents, which can be formalized as the following constraint:
max
min

bτ
rA−j

 .
(17)
However, in cooperative settings with coupled or global re-
wards, multiple agents receive identical rewards. In these
scenarios, policy improvement within the agent subset Aj can
inevitably cause an increase in maxbτ rA−j
t
. Therefore, the
SED module focuses on constraining the term
minbτ rA−j
t

within the range maxeτ
rA−j
t
, thereby optimizing worst-case
reward fluctuations. Specifically, the SED module constructs
a timestep set T j, consisting of all timesteps in the expert
demonstration trajectory set bτ where the external agent’s
reward is lower than the maximum absolute reward in the
agent trajectory set eτ:
T j =

(18)
The SED module further establishes the correspondence be-
tween the reward volatility index and LLM-generated instruc-
tions by constructing a reward-instruction pair set Rj, which
enables iterative feedback on the instruction sequence, as
follows:
Rj =

 , ei

(19)
To minimize the policy divergence index, we estimate the
KL divergence between the pre-update policy eπi and the post-
update policy bπi for each agent i ∈Aj. Given the trajectory
set bτ and the current policy πi, we approximate the updated
policy bπi as follows:
bπi  ui | oi
t

=
(

 ui −ui

∃oi
t, ui

(20)
where δ denotes the Dirac delta function. This approximation
treats the observation-action pairs
 oi
t, ui
t

in the trajectory bτ
as deterministic action outputs of the policy, while retaining
the original policy distribution for all other observation inputs.
In this way, the influence of expert demonstrations on the
updated policy of agent i is explicitly captured. Consequently,
the KL divergence between the pre- and post-update policies
for agent i at an observation oi
t is given by:
DKL
 bπi ∥eπi

where (oi

E. Hybrid Expert-Agent Policy Optimization Module
In this section, we propose the HPO module, a fully decen-
tralized MARL training framework that adaptively combines
expert demonstrations from Section III-D with autonomous
exploration samples, thus accelerating policy convergence and
enhancing agent performance.
The HPO module adopts a fully decentralized framework,
where the training and execution of each agent are independent
to ensure scalability. Specifically, as described in Section III-D,
the SED module generates the expert trajectory set τ e and
the agent trajectory set τ a. For each agent i, we denote its
own trajectories by τ e,i ∈τ e and τ a,i ∈τ a, where the
superscripts a and e indicate trajectories derived from agent-
environment interactions and expert instruction executions. To
perform policy evaluation and subsequent policy fusion, we
define the agent and expert value functions as follows:
V x
i (ox,i
t ) = Eτ x,i

k=t

where x ∈{a, e}, ox,i

are the observation and reward
at time step k in trajectory τ x,i. Subsequently, we compute the
finite-horizon bootstrapped return for each trajectory using the
agent and expert value functions, V a

Relying solely on expert demonstration samples often re-
sults in limited sample diversity, which constrains the agent’s
policy generalization to unknown states. Furthermore, in par-
tially observable environments, LLMs are unable to access
complete state information, which may lead to suboptimal
expert demonstrations. To address these limitations, we pro-
pose a hybrid policy optimization mechanism that integrates
both expert demonstration samples and agent autonomous
exploration samples. This approach enables the agent to further
optimize its policy beyond what can be achieved by learning
from expert knowledge alone. Specifically, we first compute
the agent and expert advantages for the respective trajectories
as follows:
Ax,i
t
= Rx,i
t
−V x
i (ox,i
t ).
(28)
We then adopt the clipped surrogate objective [65] to construct
the agent and expert policy losses using the agent and expert
advantages, respectively:
Lx(πi) = Eτ x,i
h
min(ωx,i
t , clip(ωx,i
t , 1 −ϵ, 1 + ϵ))Ax,i
t

where ωx,i
t
= πi(ux,i
t |ox,i
t )/πold,i(ux,i
t |ox,i
t ) denotes the im-
portance sampling ratio, πold,i denotes the policy of agent
i from the previous iteration, and ϵ ∈(0, 1) represents the
clipping coefficient. Consequently, we define the hybrid policy
loss function Lmix as follows:
Lmix(πi) = αLa(πi) + (1 −α)Le(πi),
(30)
where α = exp
 −k/K · DDTW(τ a,i, τ e,i)

dynamically ad-
justs the weighting between the agent and expert policy
losses, with k and K denoting the current and total train-
ing epochs, respectively, and DDTW(τ a,i, τ e,i) denotes the
dynamic time warping (DTW) distance, which measures the
similarity between agent and expert trajectories via nonlinear
temporal alignment. To promote autonomous exploration, we
incorporate a maximum entropy regularization term into the
hybird policy loss function, which is defined as follows:
L(πi) = Lmix(πi) + βEτ a,i[H(πi(·|oa,i
t ))],
(31)
where β ∈(0, 1] denotes the entropy regularization coefficient,
and H denotes the entropy of the policy distribution.
As shown in Figure 2, during the initial training phase, the
agent lacks sufficient experience, which leads to a substantial
discrepancy between its policy and the expert demonstrations.
The resulting large DTW distance induces a low hybrid
weight α that prioritizes expert-guided policy optimization. As
training progresses and the agent’s policy converges towards
the expert’s behavior, the DTW distance decreases, leading
to a gradual increase in α and the optimization increasingly
emphasizes experiences gained through agent’s autonomous
exploration. In parallel, the SED module will periodically
leverage environmental feedback to refine and provide updated
demonstrations, mitigating the non-stationarity resulting from
current policy updates. With each refinement, the difference
between the previous and new demonstrations enlarges the
DTW distance, which reduces α and guides the agent to
optimize its policy to follow the new demonstrations.This
iterative mechanism, integrating both expert guidance and
self-exploration, enables the agent to continuously improve
its policy, thereby achieving efficient learning and improved
generalization across complex tasks.
Algorithm 1 outlines the training procedure of RELED,
where q denotes the sampling interval for expert demonstra-
tion. The training process begins with the initialization of the
agent policy πi, agent value function V a,i, and expert value
function V e,i for each agent i (line 1). Subsequently, the LLM
Π is loaded, and the initial prompt dinit is set (line 2). At each
training epoch, the agent trajectory set τ a is collected by exe-
cuting the current joint policy in the environment (line 4). To
improve the stability of policy updates, the SED module adopts
a sampling interval q, allowing each agent to utilize the same
expert demonstration over multiple epochs (lines 6-17). During
each demonstration generation, the agent set A is randomly
partitioned into m disjoint subsets (line 7). For each subset
Aj, expert trajectories τ e,j are obtained by applying LLM-
generated instructions to agents in Aj, while the remaining
agents follow their own policy decisions (line 11). The reward-
instruction pair set Rj and the policy divergence-instruction
pair set Kj are calculated to quantitatively assess the impact
of the demonstration on environment stationarity (line 12),
and these results are integrated into the feedback prompt
for LLM refinement (line 13). Subsequently, the observation
information from the expert trajectory set τ e is incorporated
into the feedback prompts to provide the LLM with detailed
context on expert instruction executions (line 16). In the HPO
module, each agent extracts its own agent trajectory and expert
trajectory for policy evaluation and improvement (line 20).
Bootstrapped returns Ra,i
t , Re,i
t
and advantages Aa,i
t , Ae,i
t
are
calculated (line 21), serving as inputs to update agent and
expert value functions via mean squared error loss (line 22),
and to optimize policy πi using the hybrid loss with entropy
regularization (line 23).
IV. IMPLEMENTATION
This section describes the experimental setups and imple-
mentation details of RELED.
A. Environment Setups
1) Simulation: We evaluate RELED in multi-agent naviga-
tion tasks in realistic urban traffic environments constructed
from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data [66] and simulated in
SUMO [67]. OSM data are converted to SUMO via a standard
netconvert pipeline, including geometry simplification, ramp
inference, junction merging, standardizing intersections and
signals while preserving lane counts, one-way attributes, and
speed limits.
Each agent controls a single vehicle navigating from an as-
signed origin to a designated destination. For fair comparison,
origin–destination pairs are sampled once at random from a
predefined set and then fixed identically for all methods and
runs. A single environment interaction step corresponds to one
agent perform an action. The simulator advances in discrete
steps last up to 2400 simulator steps in total, terminating early
if all agents reach their destinations.
For each map, we consider two background traffic regimes
to emulate different demand levels: (i) moderate flow, with
90 background vehicles distributed according to edge lengths;
and (ii) congested flow, with 190 background vehicles and
increased injection frequency on major arterials. Background
vehicles has randomness in route assignment, departure times,
and lane selection, and their origin–destination pairs are
sampled from the same predefined set as the agents. The
experiments span two representative urban networks:
• Orlando: A canonical grid with uniform intersections
(Figure 3(a,b)), featuring 115 regulated intersections and
269 edges across a 1.99 km² area. This environment
primarily consists of four-way junctions with consistent
lane configurations.
• Hong Kong: An urban road network (Figure 3(c,d)) span-
ning 3.87 square kilometers, comprising 144 regulated
intersections and 239 road segments, characterized by
roads with extended edge lengths and a high prevalence
of one-way traffic routes.
2) Hyperparameters:
Each independent run consisted of
5 × 102 training epochs and each epoch comprising 103
environment interaction steps, accumulating a total of 5 × 105
interaction steps. Unless otherwise specified, all experiments

were conducted with 10 agents operating in the environment.
All algorithms are configured with identical optimizer param-
eters, with the learning rate = 3 × 10−4 and The discount
factor γ = 0.99. Both policy networks and value estimation
networks across all algorithms employed the same two-layer
neural network structure with 128 neurons per layer. For
LLM demonstration sampling, we employed a periodic update
strategy with interval q = 10 epochs. For RELED, the agent
subset partitioning parameter m = 2.
3) Reward Function:
The reward at interaction step k
is designed to encourage minimal travel time and progress
toward the destination:
Rk = −(tk −tk−1) + ωd(dk−1 −dk),
(32)
where Rk is the reward at step k; tk and tk−1 are the
current and previous simulation times; ωd is set to 1 in our
experiments; and dk and dk−1 are the current and previous
Euclidean distances to the destination. The first term penalizes
elapsed time, and the second term rewards reductions in
distance to the destination—when the distance decreases, the
agent receives a positive reward proportional to that decrease.
Upon reaching the destination, the agent receives an additional
terminal reward Rterm = 0.1 · Tmax, where Tmax is the
maximum number of simulation steps.

4) Observation Space: Agents operate with partially obser-
vation space, with visibility limited to all outgoing edges of
the junction they are approaching. The observation space of a
single agent contains the current junction ID, the destination
junction ID, and for each potential outgoing edge, its score
and the end junction ID. The edge score ranges from 0 to
1, calculated as the ratio between the free flow travel time
(length/max speed) and the estimated travel time. Detailed
environment specifications are summarized in Table 1.
5) Action Space:
The action space is a discrete selection
of available road segments at each junction. When an agent
reaches an intersection, it must choose one outgoing edge from
mout options. For each map, mout is fixed and set to the
maximum number of outgoing roads at any junction in that
map. For junctions with fewer than mout edges, the excess
dimensions are masked with a −1. For the Orlando and Hong
Kong maps used in our experiments, mout = 4.
B. Baselines
To evaluate the performance of RELED, we compare it with
the following MARL methods:
• IPPO [26]: An extension of PPO where each agent
is trained independently with its own policy and value
networks, using on-policy data.
• MAPPO [25]: A CTDE method that trains decentralized
policies together with a centralized value function that
has access to global information during training.
• QMIX [27]: A value factorization approach that com-
bines individual agent value functions through a mono-
tonic mixing network to form a joint action-value func-
tion for decentralized control.
C. RELED Prompt Design
We implement a prompting architecture to generate high-
quality LLM-based expert demonstrations for the RELED
framework. We employ GPT-3.5 Turbo as our foundational
model and structure our prompting approach in a two-phase
methodology. Detailed prompt templates and example re-
sponses can be found in Appendix A.
1) Initial Prompt:
The initial prompt defines the task
and outlines the context of the environment. The model
receives the network topology (node coordinates and a directed
adjacency list), each agent’s origin–destination pair, and its
departure time. We also provide a small set of navigation
utility interfaces (Table II), which are thin wrappers around
SUMO’s built-in path planning and information routines.

Finally, we specify output constraints with instructions to
generate exeutable Python code format. In practice, the above
prompt serves as the system prompt for the model. To maintain
computational efficiency, the context window is limited to
10,000 tokens; earlier historical information is discarded as
needed, while the system prompt is preserved throughout the
interaction process. In addition, the initial prompt contains a
simple command to trigger the instruction.
2) Feedback Prompt: Every q = 10 epochs, we compile
a summary of recent agent exploration and expert-generated
plans and deliver it to the LLM as a structured feedback
prompt. The summary includes two diagnostics: (i) reward
volatility index (RVI): As defined in Eqn. 19, RVI identifies
groups whose substituted expert policies produce the largest
single-step reward decreases for agents running the current
DRL policy, together with the associated states and triggering
instructions; (ii) the policy divergence index (PDI): As defined
in Eqn. 24, PDI computed as the KL divergence between
expert and learned policies at matched decision states, together
with the associated states and triggering instructions. Using the
combined information, the LLM revises the expert plans to
mitigate cross-agent interference and reduce policy mismatch.
V. EVALUATION
In this section, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate
the effectiveness of our proposed method RELED.
A. Comparative Results
This section compare RELED with state-of-the-art MARL
methods on sample efficiency and time efficiency.
1) Sample Efficiency: Figure 4 demonstrates that RELED
consistently outperforms all baseline approaches in both sam-
ple efficiency and final performance across all four test sce-
narios. RELED achieves higher average episode rewards with
fewer training steps. In the moderate traffic conditions of (a)
Orlando and (c) Hong Kong, RELED rapidly reaches strong
performance levels and continues to improve steadily. In the
more challenging congested environments of (b) Orlando and
(d) Hong Kong, RELED maintains consistently higher average
rewards per interaction step compared to all baseline methods.
The complementary metrics average travel time presented
in Figure 4 (e)-(h) provide further evidence of RELED’s
superior performance. Average travel time directly reflects
agent effectiveness in traffic management scenarios as a pure
optimization objective, unaffected by reward shaping compo-
nents. Time unit here is SUMO simulator time step, which
is the standard temporal measurement in the SUMO traffic
simulation environment. RELED reduces travel times more
rapidly and converges to lower values than the baselines. This
highlights RELED’s enhanced ability to efficiently translate
sample experiences into effective policy improvements across
diverse urban networks and traffic conditions.
2) Time Efficiency: Figure 5 illustrates the progression of
average episode reward over training time. Despite the addi-
tional computational overhead introduced by LLM inference,
RELED remains competitive in time efficiency. For Orlando
– moderate, even with the maximum historical context, the
average time for a single refinement inference is only 7.35 ±
4.86 seconds, which is small relative to the overall training
duration. More detailed analysis of model inference time is
presented in Section V-C. Across both urban environments and
traffic conditions, RELED achieves higher average rewards
earlier than all baselines, establishing an early performance
advantage that is maintained throughout the training process.
These results shows that the incremental inference cost is more
than offset by the resulting more informative updates, yielding
greater performance gains per unit time.

module.
1) Trajectories Visualization: Figure 6 visualizes expert
demonstrations and agent-generated trajectories in Orlando
- Moderate and Hong Kong - Moderate. The visualization
presents samples from the final training phase, showing the last
10 episodes for both expert and agent trajectories.The data is
log-transformed and normalized to [0,1] to better represent the
right-skewed distribution of traffic flow. In both environments,
expert demonstrations reveal concentrated traffic flow along
key corridor chains connecting origins and destinations. DRL
agents successfully replicate these primary corridors while
maintaining comparable flow intensities on critical segments,
demonstrating effective policy transfer. Differences primarily
emerge in secondary connections near intersections, where
the agents redistribute some traffic flow. This reflects the
inherent exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement
learning. Agents leverage expert demonstrations as a structural
foundation while conducting exploration on peripheral edges
to discover potentially improved routing decisions.
2) Policy Alignment: To quantify this alignment, Figure 7
reports the DTW distance between expert and agent trajecto-
ries across training, together with the average episode reward.
DTW measures the similarity between temporal sequences by
finding the optimal nonlinear alignment between them. Lower
DTW denotes closer adherence to the expert policy. In both
environment, DTW drops quickly in the early epochs and stays
relatively low thereafter, while reward rises. In RELED, a
lower DTW leads to a reduced weighting of expert samples
in policy updates through the coefficient α, as expressed in
Eqn. 30. The result shows that the agents gradually shifts
learning toward self-generated experience, continuously im-
proving performance even after achieving close alignment with
expert behavior.

C. Demonstration Analysis of SED Module
In this section, we evaluate LLM-generated demonstrations
across various refinement phases, model choices, and prompt
designs. We also identify how the SED module contributes to
high-quality demonstrations through its structured interfaces
and iterative feedback mechanisms.
1) LLM Model Choice: Table III presents our evaluation of
LLM-generated demonstrations across three refinement phases
in Orlando - Moderate. For each phase, 100 expert trajec-
tories (10 prompts × 10 agents) are collected. We evaluated
four widely-used LLMs of varying parameter sizes for their
impact on the quality of expert demonstrations. GPT-4 Turbo
achieves the highest rewards (752.84 ± 65.32 with full setting
at 50 iterative refinements) but requires substantially longer
inference times (19.55 ± 1.70 seconds). GPT-3.5 Turbo and
Llama-3.1-70b show competitive performance (684.76 ± 57.34
and 708.46 ± 47.28 rewards) with faster inference (7.35 ± 4.86
and 6.86 ± 1.35 seconds), offering excellent balance between
quality and computational efficiency. In our experiments, we
selected GPT-3.5 Turbo for this balanced performance profile.
Overall, larger models tend to deliver higher rewards and ex-
ecution rates on average, whereas smaller models like Llama-
3.1-8B are attractive with strict computational constraints (e.g.,

4.64 ± 0.60 s at 50 refinements).
2) Impact of Prompt Design: The ablation study of prompt
design in Table III highlights how different components im-
pact the quality of expert demonstrations. In the absence of
refinement feedback (Refn.), DTW difference decreases sub-
stantially. For example, with GPT-3.5 Turbo (50 refinements),
the DTW difference drops to 836.66 ± 206.82 (vs. 1040.50 ±
174.15 with both components). This pronounced reduction in
DTW indicates that the feedback mechanism, by iteratively
refining model outputs, enhances the consistency between
expert demonstrations and reinforcement learning samples.
Providing LLMs with predefined navigation interfaces (IFs)
generally improves performance, compared to letting LLM
generate complete node-connected routes. This advantage is
more pronounced in higher refinement iterations where there
is more context. At 50 refinements, without IFs, execution
rates decline dramatically while rewards decrease substantially
— GPT-3.5 Turbo’s execution rate falls from 85% to 67.00%
and rewards drop from 684.76 ± 57.34 to 428.92 ± 62.16, with
inference time also increasing significantly from 7.35 ± 4.86
to 12.46 ± 1.40.

after 20 test episodes of these models. Across all scales,
RELED maintains the highest median reward compared to
IPPO, MAPPO, and QMIX. As the population grows from 5
to 20, all methods experience some degradation, but RELED’s
decline is more gradual. These results indicate that the pro-
posed approach scales more robustly with the number of
agents.
E. Ablation Study
This section evaluates the impact of each module of RELED
performance. We compare the following variants: (i) RELED
(Full); (ii) RELED w/o Refn.: Implemented without iterative
prompt refinement; (iii) RELED-α0.2; (iv) RELED-α0.5: Using
fixed expert weights α = 0.2 and α = 0.5 instead of dynamic
α calculated by DTW distance; (v) RELED-Logit: Replacing
LLM-generated demonstrations with a logit-based softmax
over shortest-path costs to prioritize lower-cost routes; and (vi)
IPPO.
1) Training Performance:
Figure 9 presents our ablation
study comparing these RELED variants in training perfor-
mance. RELED (Full) achieves the fastest performance gains
and the highest episode reward in both environments with
reduced variance throughout training. This suggests that itera-
tively updating expert demostrations can help improve training
efficiency. Removing iterative refinement (RELED w/o Refn.)
slows late-stage reward improvement. Using fixed expert
weights RELED-α0.2/RELED-α0.5) further reduces sample

efficiency; an overly large expert weight (α = 0.5) leads to
insufficient exploration and a sharp late-stage reward drop, es-
pecially in (a) Orlando. This validates the advantage of DTW-
based adaptive weighting for scheduling the transition from
imitation to exploration. RELED-Logit shows higher early
sample efficiency but overall lags behind RELED (Full), sug-
gesting that LLM-derived trajectories provide higher-quality,
more context-aware guidance than logit-stochastic routing.
2) Converged Performance:
Table IV reports the perfor-
mance of the convergent model of each method, tested over 20
independent runs. RELED (Full) achieves the highest rewards
with minimal travel times in both networks. RELED-Logit
attains 43.37% lower reward and 65.24% longer travel time
than RELED (Full) in Orlando, with similar gaps in Hong
Kong. Fixed-weight configurations show severe performance
degradation, with α = 0.5 yielding negative rewards in
Orlando (-109.65%) and substantial drops in Hong Kong (-
53.86%), while α = 0.2 also degrades performance in both en-
vironments (-34.41% and -23.39% lower rewards). Removing
refinement (RELED w/o Refn.) results in modest performance
drops across both environments (-19.79% and -26.15% lower
rewards). These results quantitatively demonstrate the impact
of each RELED component on overall converged performance.
VI. CONCLUSION
We propose RELED, a scalable MARL framework that
effectively integrates LLM-driven expert demonstrations with
autonomous agent exploration. The SED module leverages
theoretical non-stationarity bounds to guide the generation and
refinement of high-quality expert trajectories, improving cu-
mulative rewards and training stability. Furthermore, the HPO
module adaptively balances learning from both expert- and
agent-generated experiences, accelerating policy convergence
and enhancing generalization for each agent. Experimental
results show that RELED achieves better sample and time
efficiency across scenarios, maintains performance advantages
with increasing agent numbers in practical traffic management
applications. As a potential future direction, we are looking
forward to extending our method to improve the performance
of various applications such as robot control [68]–[73] and
autonomous driving [23], [74]–[76].
