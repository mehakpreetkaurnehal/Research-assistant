Abstract— This study aimed to explore the application of deep 
neural networks for whole-body human posture prediction during 
dynamic load-reaching activities. Two time-series models were 
trained using bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and 
transformer architectures. The dataset consisted of 3D full-body 
plug-in gait dynamic coordinates from 20 normal-weight healthy 
male individuals each performing 204 load-reaching tasks from 
different load positions while adapting various lifting and 
handling techniques. The model inputs consisted of the 3D position 
of the hand-load position, lifting (stoop, full-squat and semi-squat) 
and handling (one- and two-handed) techniques, body weight and 
height, and the 3D coordinate data of the body posture from the 
first 25% of the task duration. These inputs were used by the 
models to predict body coordinates during the remaining 75% of 
the task period. Moreover, a novel method was proposed to 
improve the accuracy of the previous and present posture 
prediction networks by enforcing constant body segment lengths 
through the optimization of a new cost function. The results 
indicated that the new cost function decreased the prediction error 
of the models by approximately 8% and 21% for the arm and leg 
models, respectively. We indicated that utilizing the transformer 
architecture, with a root-mean-square-error of 47.0 mm, exhibited 
~58% more accurate long-term performance than the BLSTM-
based model. This study merits the use of neural networks that 
capture time series dependencies in 3D motion frames, providing 
a unique approach for understanding and predict motion 
dynamics during manual material handling activities.

I. INTRODUCTION 
ANUAL material handling (MMH) activities have 
been identified as a risk factor for spinal injuries [1]. 
To assess the risk of injury in different daily 
activities, 
practitioners 
in 
the 
field 
of 
occupational 
biomechanics need to estimate external loads and moments in 
intervertebral joints. As direct measurements of these loads and 
moments are costly and invasive, musculoskeletal models and 
ergonomic-based risk assessment tools have been developed for 
this purpose [2], [3], [4], [5]. These biomechanical models 
require, as inputs, the individual's body posture data during the 
occupational activity under consideration. Analyzing human 
body movement by traditional methods such as motion capture 
cameras [6], [7], [8], [9], [10] or wearable sensors [11], [12], 
[13] is also costly, time-consuming, subject to occlusion, and 
therefore difficult to implement in real workstations. 
Developing easy-to-use yet accurate human posture prediction 
approaches during such occupational activities is, hence, 
essential. 
The analysis of human movement, particularly for tasks 
involving MMH activities, has significantly benefited from the 
integration of computational techniques like computer vision 
(CV) and machine learning (ML) [14]. Several posture 
prediction models for MMH activities have been developed by 
our research group [12], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] and 
others [21], [22], [23]. In all these models, body motion data of 
several subjects are first measured in laboratory settings, and 
subsequently, machine learning-based prediction models are 
trained and validated using the collected data. The input 
parameters of these models are easily measurable and 
applicable in occupational environments. Some studies [12], 
[16], [17], [18], [19], [21] have used regular fully connected 
neural networks (FCNs) to predict posture, while others [22], 
[24] have employed generative models such as conditional 
variational autoencoders and conditional generative adversarial 
networks. Moreover, the performance of generative models 
have been compared to that of an FCN, both having similar 
errors in predicting body posture [22]. However, these models 
do not accurately capture the time-varying nature of dynamic 
load-reaching or load-moving activities. Moreover, almost all 
earlier posture prediction models [12], [15], [18], [19], [23] 
were developed for static tasks or assumed temporal 
independence for each movement frame for dynamic tasks [16], 
[17].

Fig. 1. The process of generating inputs to the neural networks from time series data: for each segment, the 3D coordinates of the 
markers in lin = 25 input frames and the task characteristics are combined to generate one sample for input to the networks. 
 
This means that they did not consider any correlation or 
relationship between the movement frames as time series. 
Recent advancements in deep learning, however, offer 
potential solutions to address these temporal limitations [14]. 
For instance, long short-term memory (LSTM) models has been 
used to predict gait trajectory [25], [26] and a comparative 
analysis of LSTM, FCN, convolutional neural networks 
(CNNs), and transformer deep learning models was conducted 
for predicting gait trajectories [27]. It is concluded that the FCN 
and transformer outperformed the other models in long-term 
prediction due to their stability and low error rates [27]. 
Therefore, transformer networks are recommended for 
predicting biomechanical time series [27]. Furthermore, some 
studies have explored enhancing LSTM models with attention 
mechanisms to improve the performance [28], [29], [30]. S. Li 
et al. [29] and Zhu et al. [28] introduced attention layers at the 
input stage to weight features before passing them into the 
LSTM for joint angle prediction. Similarly, Ding et al. [30] 
demonstrated that an attention-enhanced LSTM network could 
estimate ankle and hip acceleration prediction from inertial 
measurement unit (IMU) signals by leveraging complementary 
limb data with 9.06% and 7.64% normalized root mean square 
error (nRMSE). Wu et al. [31], developed a novel time series 
forecasting method using a Transformer architecture with self-
attention mechanisms, achieving a root mean square error 
(RMSE) of 0.605 in influenza-like illness forecasting using 
time delay embeddings. These suggest that both deep learning 
architectures—particularly those utilizing recurrent structures 
(such as LSTM and bidirectional-LSTM (BLSTM)) and 
attention-based models (transformer)—are strong candidates 
for predicting biomechanical time series data. 
Therefore, although deep learning models have been widely 
used to predict one-dimensional (1D) periodic biomechanical 
signals such as joint angles[25], [26], [27], [32], to the best of 
our knowledge, they have not been applied to the prediction of 
full-body, three-dimensional (3D), and non-periodic posture 
data. This presents a gap in the current literature, particularly 
for dynamic and complex movements. The present study, aims  
to predict human posture during load-reaching activities as time 
series data using BLSTM and transformer deep neural networks 
to evaluate their prediction accuracy and compare their 
outcomes to those of FCN-based models. Moreover, kinematic 
constraints based on the length of body segments (i.e., forearms, 
arms, and shanks) are included in the loss function and their 
effects on network performance are investigated. It is 
hypothesized that these models are robust tools for predicting 
dynamic 3D full-body posture. 
II. METHODS 
A. Data collection 
    The motion dataset collected in our previous study was used 
[18]. Twenty healthy right-handed male individuals (73.7±10.1 
kg, 177.8±4.2 cm, 24±2 years) without any history of 
musculoskeletal disorders in the last six months each performed 
204 load-reaching tasks (Table I). Ten Vicon motion capture 
cameras measured kinematics of the subjects' body movement 
during each load-reaching activity (i.e., reaching the load 
destination from the neutral upright standing posture) at a 
sampling frequency of 120 Hz. Thirty-nine markers were 
placed on each subject’s body landmarks based on the full-body 
plug-in gate standard [33], [34] while two additional markers 
were placed on their T12 and S1 vertebrae [18]. These 
additional markers helped determine the kinematics of the spine 
more accurately. The measured trajectories of these markers for 
each load-reaching task were subsequently resampled in 101 
frames to have the same length between tasks and subjects. 
 
B. Data preprocessing 
    3D coordinate data were filtered using a zero-lag phase 4th 
order low-pass Butterworth filter with a 10 Hz cut-off 
frequency. All data points were within expected biomechanical 
ranges and showed no anomalies that would justify removal. 
The data from 20 subjects were then randomly divided into the 
training, validation, and test sets (14, 4, and 2 subjects, 
respectively). The training dataset was used to update the 
parameters of the model, the validation dataset was used to 
adjust the hyperparameters of the model, and the performance 
of the model was reported using the test dataset. The samples

for each dataset were generated using the conventional sliding 
window method with a length of 25 frames (i.e., 3D coordinates 
of 25 frame motions) and a stride of 1 frame [26].  
    A sample X (Fig. 1) in each set was a matrix of shape 𝑙𝑖𝑛×  𝑓 
,𝑙𝑖𝑛 is the number of input frames (set to 25 in this study), and 
𝑓 is the number of features. These features included the 3D 
coordinates of body markers, along with seven task- and 
subject-related characteristics: the 3D final coordinates of the 
load-reaching position, the handling technique (one- or two-
handed), the lifting technique (upright standing, semi-squat, full 
squat, or stoop), and the subject’s body height and mass. The 
networks received integer-encoded values for the lifting and 
handling techniques. Specifically, 0, 1, 2, and 3 represented 
upright standing, stoop, semi-squat, and full-squat lifting 
techniques, respectively, while 1 and 2 indicated one- and two-
handed handling techniques. 
    The label that corresponds to a sample X was represented by 
a vector y, with a shape of 3m×1 in which m denotes the number 
of markers attached to the body. The vector contains the 3D 
coordinates of the markers in the next frame.  The generated 
samples were normalized using Eq.(1): 
𝐗𝑖𝑗
𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙= (𝐗𝑖𝑗−𝐗̅𝑗) (𝐒̅𝑗
⁄
) 
 
(1) 
 
where Xij denotes the jth input feature at the ith frame of the 
movement and 𝐗̅𝑗 and 𝐒̅𝑗 are the mean and standard-deviation 
of the jth input feature, respectively. The mean and standard 
deviation were calculated from the training dataset. 
 
C. Deep learning models 
    Two types of deep neural networks were employed: the 
BLSTM and transformer architectures. The models were 
implemented using the PyTorch deep learning framework and 
various additional libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, 
Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Optuna. Computation was run on an 
Nvidia Geforce RTX 4060 GPU. To reduce the number of 
model parameters, the markers affixed to the individual's body 
were divided into four segments: head (4 markers), arms (7 
markers for each arm), body-pelvic (7 markers for the trunk and 
4 markers for the pelvic), and legs (6 markers for each leg) (Fig 
2). For each segment, separate networks were trained so that to 
predict body posture at each frame all four separate networks 
were executed simultaneously. 
    Each model was trained to predict the next frame based on 
the input data consisting of the previous 25 frames. The first 25 
frames of each task needed to predict the remaining 76 frames 

 
 
 
were provided using our previously developed load-reaching 
whole-body posture prediction model based on static frames 
[16]. During the training phase, the model employed the latest 
in-vivo measured data to make predictions for the next 
immediate observation in the time series; which is also known 
as the short-term prediction method. In contrast, during the 
evaluation phase, the predictive capability of the model was 
recursively utilized to forecast the entire time series. This 
method, known as recursive long-term prediction, used the  
predicted frames of the model as inputs for the next prediction 
step [32]. For instance, frame 26 could be predicted from frames 
1 to 25, and then frame 27 could be predicted from frames 2 to 
26 (considering that frame 26 was already obtained from the 
prediction of the model). Consequently, the prediction for each 
frame was dependent on the predictions made for the previous 
frames, enabling the generation of a complete sequence of 
forecasts encompassing all 101 motion frames. The 
architectures and methods used for training and setting the 
hyperparameters of the models are explained hereafter. 
 
C.1. BLSTM: 
    BLSTMs, bidirectional RNN variants, process sequences 
forward and backward (Fig. 3), outperforming unidirectional 
LSTMs [35], [36]. In this study, a single layer of BLSTM with 
128 hidden units was used for all body segments. The final 
hidden state of this layer was forwarded to a linear layer that 
reshaped the output to the desired shape. 
 
Fig. 3. BLSTM architecture for posture prediction. The model 
processes time-series data bidirectionally, capturing both past and 
future context [37]. Outputs from forward and backward LSTM layers 
are concatenated and passed to a fully connected layer to predict 
posture at each time step. 
  
C.2. Transformer 
    The transformer architecture, with encoder-decoder blocks 
and multi-head self-attention, has outperformed RNNs and 
CNNs across various fields [38], [39]. To predict the desired 
body kinematics, the 3D coordinates of the markers as well as 
seven selected features were input to the model in 25 input 
frames to a linear dimension expander layer. The values of this 
layer were then passed onto the transformer encoder. 
Furthermore, the marker coordinates of the last frame were 
assigned to the linear dimension expander layer and used as 
input for the decoder. Finally, the decoder output was the 
coordinates of the markers in the next frame, following the 
input frames (Fig 4). The model architecture used a single 
encoder layer and three decoder layers, each with 16 self-
attention heads. The number of feed-forward neurons were set 
to 512, and the decoder's output passed through a fully 
connected layer containing 64 neurons. A dropout probability 
of 0.25 was applied to the transformer. Before being fed into 
the transformer, the input dimensions were expanded to 96 
using a linear transformation. An identical architecture was 
adapted for all body segments.

sequences are embedded through linear layers, then processed by 
encoder-decoder blocks. The output is passed to a fully connected 
layer to generate future posture predictions using self-attention 
mechanisms. 
D. Performance metrics 
    The short- and long-term performances of the model were 
evaluated in terms of RMSE, normalized RMSE (to the range 
of measured data, nRMSE), and R2. To calculate the RMSE, the 
network's output was denormalized, and the error was 
calculated using Eq.(2):  
RMSE = √

(2) 
where n, f, and lout represent the number of samples, number of 
input features, and number of output frames (1 for short-term 
prediction and 76 for long-term prediction), respectively. The 
leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation approach was 
employed, ensuring that model generalization was evaluated on 
completely unseen individuals, which further mitigates 
overfitting. 
 
E. Hyperparameters 
    The models were trained using the Adam optimization 
method with parameters β₁ = 0.9, β₂ = 0.98, and ε = 1e-9 [40], 
with a mean squared error (MSE) loss function to calculate the 
discrepancy between one-step-ahead predictions and actual 
values. A leaning rate scheduler was selected by trial and error 
(factor = 0.1, patience = 5, minimum learning rate = 1e-7) 
which adjusted the learning rate based on validation loss; and 
early stopping was applied when no improvement was observed 
across multiple epochs. Model weights were updated based on 
this loss function and training continued for 150-200 epochs. 
To optimize model performance, the tree-structured Parzen 
estimator (TPE) algorithm [41], a Bayesian hyperparameter 
sampler, was employed to automatically tune hyperparameters 

 
 
 
by minimizing validation loss. The search space included 
dropout rate, number of attention heads, encoder/decoder 
layers, and other architecture parameters. Final selected values 
are listed in Table II. The batch sizes for the BLSTMs and 
transformers were set at 512. Initially, the learning rates for the 
BLSTMs and transformers were 0.01 and 0.001, respectively. 
The choices for the number of epochs, batch size, and learning 
rates were established based on trials and errors.

F. Kinematic constraints 
    To improve the performance of the models, and as a 
contribution of this study, some kinematic constraints were 
implemented by defining a new loss function. The length of the 
forearms and arms (for the arm models) and shanks (for the leg 
models) were considered constant during the task for each 
subject. To calculate the length of these segments, the 
Euclidean distance of the markers of each segment was 
calculated (Fig 2 and Table Ⅲ).  The new loss function (ℒ) was, 
therefore, computed using Eq.(3): 
ℒ=

The first term accounts for the loss of all markers of the model, 
and the second term represents the kinematic constraints for 
different segments in which 'm' denotes the number of 
constraints of the segment model and ℓ is the length of the 
segment. Three values for coefficient a were considered based 
on trials and errors (a = 1, 10, 100). 
To quantitatively evaluate the effect of this constraint, we 
computed the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the 
empirical distribution of segment lengths from the motion 
capture data distribution (P) and the predicted distributions 
from the models with and without the kinematic loss term, 
denoted 𝑄kinand 𝑄MSE, respectively using the definition of KL 
divergence as Eq.(4): 
𝐷KL(𝑃||𝑄) = ∑𝑃(𝑙) log 𝑃(𝑙)
𝑄(𝑙) 
(4) 
 
 
 
 
 
This analysis was performed over 130 movement tasks from 2 
local test subject and also 3 external test subjects.

III. RESULTS 
The short-term (one step ahead) and long-term (76 time-steps) 
predictive performance of the two trained models were evaluated. 
The BLSTM and transformer models were trained for 150 and 200 
epochs, respectively, with early stopping of the validation MSE 
loss to prevent overfitting. Moreover, batch sizes of 256 and 512 
for the BLSTM and transformer models, respectively, were used. 
The best results were obtained with a = 10 for the arm model and 
a = 1 for the leg model in the loss function (which were used for 
training of the final models in this study). 
 
A. Performance of short-term predictions 
    In the one-step-ahead prediction task, the BLSTM model 
consistently outperformed the Transformer model across all 
body segments (Table Ⅳ). The RMSE for the BLSTM model 
was relatively low: 0.21 mm for the body-pelvic segment, 0.31 
mm for the head, 0.23 mm for the arms, and 0.25 mm for the 
legs. In contrast, the Transformer model exhibited higher 
RMSE values across all body segments, with 1.85 mm for the 
body-pelvic segment, 0.96 mm for the head, 0.99 mm for the 
arms, and 0.90 mm for the legs.

predictions by recursively utilizing one-step-ahead predictions 
as inputs. A total of 76-time steps in the future (until the 101st 
frame as the last frame) were predicted for each task. The 
transformer model yielded lower RMSE values (Table Ⅴ), 
indicating its superior accuracy in comparison to the BLSTM 
model. This improved performance made the transformer 
model the preferred choice for further analysis. Its predictions

targeting a final load position at coordinates (x = 0 mm, y = 580.6 mm, z = 128.3 mm). The subject’s body dimensions were 70 kg and 180 cm 
 

 
 
 
 
Fig. 6. KL divergence values for arm and leg segments under two training conditions: models trained with MSE loss only (gray bars) and 
models trained with MSE loss plus kinematic constraints (white bars). Error bars indicate standard deviation. A significant reduction in KL 
divergence for the leg segment when using kinematic constraints is denoted by the red asterisk (p = 0.0226). This analysis was performed over 
130 movement tasks from 2 local test subjects and 3 external test subjects. The results shows that the model with the kinematic loss exhibited 
significantly lower KL divergence compared to the MSE-only model, indicating a closer match to the real segment length distributions. 
C. Effect of kinematic constraints on the performance of the 
networks 
    The inclusion of kinematic constraints improved the 
performance of the transformer-based model, i.e., the RMSEs 
decreased by ~4 and 6 mm for the neural networks of the arms 
and legs, respectively (Table Ⅴ). The results (Fig. 6) showed 
that the model with the kinematic loss 𝑄kin exhibited 
significantly lower KL divergence compared to the MSE-only 
model, indicating a closer match to the real segment length 
distributions. Furthermore, prediction accuracy (as measured 
by standard joint position error metrics) was also improved. 
This demonstrates that kinematic constraints not only yield 
more biomechanically plausible outputs but also enhance 
overall prediction performance. This improvement underscores 
the importance of maintaining realistic anatomical constraints 
during dynamic posture prediction. 
 
D. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSO) 
    Based on the findings presented in section Ⅲ. B, the 
transformer model was selected as the final model. To evaluate 
the network's generalizability, the LOSO method was 
implemented, and its performance was presented in Table Ⅵ. 
Variations in RMSE values were observed across the body 
segments, with the highest RMSE recorded for the body-pelvic 
segment (60.4 mm) and the lowest for the legs (42.3 mm). 
Despite the variability across subjects, the overall performance 
of the Transformer model is shown to demonstrate its 
robustness and ability to generalize to different individuals. 
 
E. External test dataset 
To further examine the generalizability of the developed 
models, an additional evaluation was performed using the data 
from three external subjects not included in the original dataset. 
These participants had an average weight of 71.9 ± 8.4 kg and 
height of 178.3 ± 5.9 cm. Similar load-reaching tasks were 
conducted using the same marker setup and protocol described 
in Section II.A. The transformer model with kinematic 
constraints was applied without retraining or fine-tuning. The 
performance metrics (RMSE, nRMSE, and R²) for the arms and 
legs were calculated, as summarized in Table VII. 
IV. DISCUSSION 
    This study aimed to develop deep learning models for the 
dynamic prediction of the human whole-body posture during 
load-reaching tasks. For this purpose, the full-body plug-in gait 
markers were divided into four segments. Subsequently, short-
term prediction (one-step ahead) models were trained for each 
segment based on the BLSTM and transformer architectures. 
The inputs to the models were the first 25 frames of motion as 
well as seven simple task- and subject-related characteristics. 
All motion frames during a load-reaching task could be 
predicted recursively using the previous frames. The results 
indicated that based on our tuned hyperparameters, in short-
term predictions, the BLSTM model outperformed the 
transformer (Table Ⅳ). However, for long-term predictions, the 
transformer model was more accurate than the BLSTM (Table 
Ⅴ). Despite the relatively high short-term accuracy of the 
BLSTM, we decided to use our transformer model because of 
its relatively high accuracy in the long term. 
 
A. Analysis of results 
    The increase in the error of long-term predictions could be 
related to the training process. During the training phase of the 
recurrent neural networks, all model inputs were true values; 
however, during the testing of these networks, the prediction of 
the network, which has some error itself, was input to the 
model. The accumulation of these errors during the next step of

the predictions caused the network to have more errors as the 
number of predicted frames increased. Therefore, the predicted 
value further deviated from the actual outputs in the previous 
frames. This issue is known as the “teacher forcing” or 
“exposure bias” in recurrent networks [42], [43]. One solution 
to this issue is to use a technique called “scheduled sampling” 
[44]. This involves training the model using both the actual 
input data and the predictions made by the model, allowing for 
more accurate training and thus improved results. Another 
solution to improve the performance of the BLSTM network 
can be the use of a cost function to optimize or evaluate the 
long-term in addition to optimize one-step ahead prediction. 
Since only the short-term prediction was minimized in the cost 
function of the network, it could be expected that the network 
was over-fitted on the short-term prediction. Previous studies 
[27] used dynamic time warping to choose the model with 
superior long-term prediction capabilities while simultaneously 
optimizing the MSE or RMSE errors. It was found that while 
LSTM models outperformed transformer models in short and 
long-term predictions, they were the most affected by Gaussian 
noise [27]. These results suggest that transformers are more 
resilient to noises than LSTMs and can be used for predicting 
body posture. 
    It is challenging to directly compare findings of the present 
study to those reported in the literature since no prior studies 
have investigated the use of BLSTM and transformer methods 
for posture prediction during MMH activities. Furthermore, 
previous studies have investigated different tasks, such as gait 
cycles [25], [26], [27], [45] or have used multi-layer perceptron 
(MLP) models to predict dynamic postures during MMH 
activities [12], [15], [16], [18], [19]. In agreement with one 
previous study [27], our findings indicated that BLSTM 
outperformed the transformer in short-term predictions. In 
contrast, we found that our transformer network had superior 
performance in long-term predictions as compared to the used 
BLSTM. Furthermore, in our previous model [16], posture 
prediction was conducted using a MLP model and statical time 
frames, resulting in a 41.5 mm error for the whole body based 
on LOSO cross-validation method; while in the current study, 
the error for whole body posture prediction was 54.4 mm. In 
this new transformer model, however, we used predicted frames 
recursively as subsequent inputs for the model. Consequently, 
the accumulation of prediction errors over time led to a 
relatively larger error compared to MLP posture prediction 
models. 
    The present study also proposed a new method for improving 
the accuracy of posture prediction models. The approach 
involved adding terms to the traditional MSE loss functions to 
maintain the length of body segments at their initial measured 
values. By incorporating these terms into the loss function, 
RMSEs of the arm and leg models improved from 49 to 45 mm 
(8.9% improvement) and from 28 to 22 mm (27% 
improvement). While this new loss function improved the 
accuracy of the models, its performance for other prediction 
models remains to be investigated. 
 
B. Limitations 
    There were some limitations to the current study. First, 
creating the first 25% of an individual’s movement during load-
reaching activities requires the use of motion capture 
systems/units. In this regard, as an alternative, our recent, 
whole-body posture prediction model [16] for dynamic load-
reaching tasks based on static timeframes could be used. 
Second, the collected dataset only included young and novice 
males, i.e., the generalizability of the models might not be valid 
for older, female, or experienced people. Additionally, the data 
were only applied to normal-weight, right-handed subjects, 
which means that the predictions may not be accurate for people 
with a body mass index (BMI) less than 18 or over 26 or left-
handed individuals. Furthermore, the study exclusively focused 
on load-reaching tasks and did not address load-moving or load-
leaving tasks. The tasks that could be performed with only one 
hand were limited to the use of a stoop lifting technique, and 
did not include the full squat and semi-squat lifting techniques. 

 
 
 
Moreover, the full squat and semi-squat lifting techniques were 
only tested with loads up to a height of 30 cm, making it 
challenging to anticipate scenarios involving higher load 
heights. 
V. CONCLUSION 
    This study is significant because of its use of deep learning 
to capture time series dependencies in 3D motion, offering a 
distinctive approach to understanding motion dynamics. This 
study focused on investigating the use of deep neural networks 
for predicting human postures during load-reaching activities 
using two time-series models: the BLSTM and transformer 
architectures. The models used various input parameters 
including load position, adapted lifting and handling 
techniques, body anthropometry, and early task period data to 
predict body coordinates for the later task period. Moreover, a 
new method was introduced to enhance the accuracy of posture 
prediction models by optimizing a novel loss function to 
maintain constant body segment lengths. While in short-term 
predictions, our BLSTM model outperformed the transformer 
model, for long-term predictions, our transformer model was 
more accurate than the BLSTM model.
