We introduce a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to identify the fixed points of a given
quantum operation. The method iteratively constructs the unitary transformation that maps the
computational basis onto the basis of fixed points through a reward–penalty scheme based on quan-
tum measurements. In cases where the operation corresponds to a Hamiltonian evolution, this task
reduces to determining the Hamiltonian eigenstates. The algorithm is first benchmarked on random
Hamiltonians acting on two and three qubits and then applied to many-body systems of up to six
qubits, including the transverse-field Ising model and the all-to-all pairing Hamiltonian. In both
cases, the algorithm is demonstrated to perform successfully; in the pairing model, it can also reveal
hidden symmetries, which can be exploited to restrict learning to specific symmetry sectors. Finally,
we discuss the possibility of post-selecting high-fidelity states even when full convergence has not
been reached.

INTRODUCTION
Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as
a fertile ground for research in recent years, exploring
the interplay between quantum mechanics and machine
learning [1–6]. This field aims to leverage quantum tech-
nologies to enhance various machine learning tasks, in-
cluding classification problems [7], quantum control [8],
or enhancing of quantum synchronization processes [9].
Diverse quantum algorithms have been proposed and, in
some cases, experimentally implemented, demonstrating
potential speedups over classical approaches [10, 11].
Reinforcement learning (RL) represents a fundamen-
tal approach within the field of machine learning [12]. In
contrast to supervised and unsupervised learning, which
mainly focus on identifying patterns in data [13–17],
RL addresses complex problems by framing them as the
search for an effective sequence of decisions that maxi-
mizes long-term rewards. This is accomplished through
the dynamic interaction between an agent and its en-
vironment. The learning process is driven by repeated
interactions, where actions are either rewarded or penal-
ized based on a predefined policy, aiming to maximize cu-
mulative rewards [12, 18, 19]. The intersection between
this iterative trial-and-error methodology and quantum
mechanics has given rise to a diverse body of work rang-
ing from fundamental studies [20], studies focused on
the use of quantum properties to enhance learning tasks
[21, 22], to specialized tasks such as preparation of quan-
tum states or the search for quantum error correction
strategies [23–25].

In recent years, this paradigm has continued to inspire
further developments in quantum RL [26]. For instance,
high fidelity state control has been achieved using quan-
tum RL for optimization when full observation states
are infeasible [27]. Policy iteration methods have been
explored to improve the performance of quantum rein-
forcement algorithms in the context of infinite-horizon
discounted problems [28]. Furthermore, challenges such
as managing continuous action spaces [29], as well as the
implementation of a quantum decision problem in a quan-
tum computer, have been successfully addressed [30], in-
cluding tackling eigenvalue problems in the presence of
dissipation [31–33].
The present work introduces an RL algorithm designed
to approximately learn the fixed points of a given quan-
tum operation. More precisely, the proposed algorithm
identifies the unitary transformation that maps the com-
putational basis onto the basis composed of the pure
states that remain invariant under the action of a spec-
ified quantum operation.
When the operation corre-
sponds to unitary dynamics generated by a Hamiltonian,
the fixed points coincide with its eigenstates, and the
algorithm provides the associated eigenbasis. This ap-
proach is inspired by previous work [34], which focused on
identifying the eigenvectors of unknown Hamiltonians. A
key difference is that our algorithm learns all fixed points
simultaneously, whereas in Ref. [34] the eigenstates were
determined sequentially, one at a time. Instead of identi-
fying individual eigenstates, our method learns the global
unitary transformation that connects the computational
basis to the fixed-point basis, providing a more compact
and parallelizable framework. Moreover, while the pre-
vious approach was restricted to unitary processes, the
method presented here is, in principle, applicable to gen-
eral quantum operations, including non-unitary evolu-
tions. Despite this broader applicability, in the present

work we focus exclusively on the unitary case, leaving
the analysis of noise and dissipative effects for future in-
vestigations. Preliminary results in this direction can be
found in Refs. [31–33].
It is worth noting that the problem of determining
Hamiltonian eigenstates has been addressed through a
wide variety of approaches. Specifically, in recent years,
significant efforts have been devoted to the development
of hybrid quantum-classical variational techniques aimed
at constructing approximate ground states of complex
many-body quantum systems [35–37]. Variational meth-
ods based on parametrized trial wavefunctions have been
extensively explored in different areas of physics and
chemistry [38, 39], offering the advantage, particularly
for near-term applications, of being easier to implement
on imperfect quantum devices. They have been success-
fully applied to many-body systems of moderate size;
however, as the number of qubits increases, the optimiza-
tion task typically becomes more challenging and may fail
due to the complexity of the energy landscape, with the
onset of the so-called “barren plateau” phenomenon be-
ing a paradigmatic example [40]. Extensive efforts have
been made to extend variational approaches and, in some
cases, complement them with quantum subspace diago-
nalization techniques to also provide accurate descrip-
tions of excited states [41–73]. Our aim with the method
presented here is not to compete with existing variational
algorithms, but rather to explore a non-variational alter-
native that could be useful for addressing such problems
in many-body systems. For this reason, in this paper we
also apply our RL algorithm to two types of interacting-
particle models that are relevant, respectively, for the
condensed matter and nuclear physics communities.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
In Sec. II, we provide a detailed description of the algo-
rithm. We first define the problem statement and goal,
specifying the task of learning the fixed points of a quan-
tum operation. We then present the RL protocol step
by step, detailing the iterative procedure and the re-
ward–punishment strategy. Next, we discuss strategies
to prevent convergence to spurious fixed points and de-
scribe a fine-tuning procedure after initial convergence to
further improve fidelities. Metrics for assessing conver-
gence and accuracy are also introduced, followed by ini-
tial benchmarks on random Hamiltonians that illustrate
the performance of the method. Section III focuses on
applications to physical systems, namely the transverse-
field Ising model (TFIM) and the pairing model, and
discusses extensions such as symmetry-restricted RL and
post-selection of high-fidelity states.
Finally, Sec. IV
summarizes our main findings and outlines possible di-
rections for future work.

ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION
A.
Problem statement and goal
Consider a quantum system with a state space of di-
mension d and computational basis C = {|j⟩}j∈{0,...,d−1}.
Let B = {|Φα⟩}α∈{0,...,d−1} be another, unknown or-
thonormal target basis that also spans the state space of
the system. We assume that the only information avail-
able about the basis B is that it is left invariant by a quan-
tum operation E, meaning that E(|Φα⟩⟨Φα|) = |Φα⟩⟨Φα|
for all α ∈{0, . . . , d −1}. With this hypothesis our ob-
jective is to construct, at least approximately, a unitary
transformation that maps the computational basis C onto
the target basis B (up to a permutation of their elements).
A particular case—on which we will focus later in this
work—is when the target basis B consists of the (un-
known) stationary states of a certain Hamiltonian H,
that is, H |Φα⟩= Eα |Φα⟩for all α ∈{0, . . . , d −1},
where Eα is the eigenenergy associated with the station-
ary state |Φα⟩. In this setting, the target basis B remains
invariant under the action of the quantum operation
E(•) = U(τ) • U †(τ),
(1)
where U(τ) = e−iτH/ℏis the unitary time-evolution op-
erator from time 0 to τ, with τ being a time interval
whose value is, for now, arbitrary. As we will see later,
the particular choice of the parameter τ plays a crucial
role in the correct functioning of the algorithm.
The goal of our quantum RL method is to iteratively
construct a sequence of unitary matrices {Dk}, where k
labels the iteration number, such that
lim
k→+∞Dk |j⟩≈|Φα⟩
(2)
for all |j⟩, with |Φα⟩representing some state of the basis
B. In other words, in the limit k →+∞, Dk approxi-
mately maps the basis C onto the basis B, up to a certain
permutation of its vectors.

Technical details on the iterative process
The unitary transformation generated in the (k + 1)th
iteration, Dk+1, is obtained from the unitary operator
Dk, corresponding to iteration k, according to the update
rule
Dk+1 = Dk
d−2
Y
j=0
d−1
Y
l=j+1
D(j,l)
k
,
(3)
where the d(d −1)/2 operators D(j,l)
k
are unitary trans-
formations. The index (j, l) refers to the C basis states.
In this product, the operators are arranged from left to
right according to the increasing sequence of index pairs
(j, l), ordered lexicographically. Specifically, (j1, l1) pre-
cedes (j2, l2) if either j1 < j2, or j1 = j2 and l1 < l2.

3
We assume that the unitary operators D(j,l)
k
are taken
as rotations acting on the two-dimensional subspace
spanned by |j⟩and |l⟩. These rotations can be expressed
in terms of the Pauli-type operators

X(j,l) = |j⟩⟨l| + |l⟩⟨j| ,
Y (j,l) = −i(|j⟩⟨l| −|l⟩⟨j|),
Z(j,l) = |j⟩⟨j| −|l⟩⟨l| ,
(4)
which serve as their generators. Specifically, the opera-
tors D(j,l)
k
are expressed as
D(j,l)

where the angles α(j,l)
k
, β(j,l)
k
, and γ(j,l)
k
are chosen de-
pending on whether the corresponding action is rewarded
or penalized. In the case of a reward, all angles are set
to zero, so that D(j,l)
k
reduces to the identity operator I.
This corresponds to no exploration, i.e., pure exploita-
tion in RL terms. Conversely, in the case of a penalty, the
angles are drawn pseudo-randomly and uniformly within
intervals that are dynamically adjusted during the learn-
ing process, allowing exploration of the space of unitary
operators.
Schematically, these intervals are expanded in response
to penalties and contracted in response to rewards,
thereby regulating the extent of exploration in the space
of unitary operators. The degree of exploration at iter-
ation k is controlled via a set of d(d −1)/2 exploration
parameters w(j,l)
k
≤1, whose evolution with the num-
ber of iterations depends on the cumulative number of
rewards and punishments received up to that point (see
the discussion below for further details).
C.
RL algorithm step-by-step
The algorithm is implemented on a set of d d-
dimensional systems (qudits), each initialized in a dis-
tinct state of the computational basis. Specifically, the
initial density operator of the full system is
ρ1 = |0⟩⟨0| ⊗|1⟩⟨1| ⊗· · · ⊗|d −1⟩⟨d −1| .
(6)
The iterative process begins with the initial assignments
D1 = I and w(j,l)
1
= 1 for all index pairs (j, l) such that
0 ≤j < l ≤d −1. At each iteration, the values of Dk+1
and the parameters w(j,l)
k+1 are updated based on those
from the previous iteration, Dk and w(j,l)
k
, following the
procedure described below:
1. Apply Dk: The unitary transformation Dk is ap-
plied to each qudit individually, yielding the density op-
erator
ρk = ρ(0)
k
⊗ρ(1)
k
⊗· · · ⊗ρ(d−1)
k
,
(7)
with ρ(j)
k
= Dk |j⟩⟨j| D†
k.
2. Apply E: Next, the quantum operation E is ap-
plied to each qudit individually, resulting in the updated
density operator
˜ρk = ˜ρ(0)
k
⊗˜ρ(1)
k
⊗· · · ⊗˜ρ(d−1)
k
,
(8)
with ˜ρ(j)
k
= E(ρ(j)
k ).
3. Undo Dk: The next step consists in reversing the
unitary transformation applied in step 2 for each qudit.
This yields the density operator
˜˜ρk = ˜˜ρ(0)
k
⊗˜˜ρ(1)
k
⊗· · · ⊗˜˜ρ(d−1)
k
,
(9)
with ˜˜ρ(j)
k
= D†
k ˜ρ(j)
k Dk.
4.
Measure:
Then, a projective measurement is
performed on each qudit in the computational basis,
with the result for the jth qudit denoted by m(j)
k
∈
{0, 1, . . . , d −1}. It is worth noting that if, at a given
iteration k, the target were exactly reached—namely, if
Dk mapped the computational basis C onto the basis B
(up to a permutation of their elements)—then the density
operator ρk would remain invariant under the quantum
operation E. In that case, we would have ˜ρk = ρk, and
upon reversing the transformation Dk, the initial density
operator would be recovered, i.e., ˜˜ρk = ρ1. If this condi-
tion held, the measurement outcomes would satisfy the
equality m(j)
k
= j for all j ∈{0, . . . , d −1} with prob-
ability one. This is equivalent to stating that, for each
label j and any l ̸= j, the condition m(j)
k
̸= l would hold
with probability one. Any outcome consistent with this
condition would indicate that the goal may have been
achieved and should therefore be rewarded, whereas any
violation would imply that the objective has not yet been
reached and should be penalized.
5.
Determination
of
D(j,l)
k
and
w(j,l)
k+1
(re-
ward/punishment):
Depending on the outcomes of
the previous measurements, the following procedure is
carried out for each pair of qudits (j, l) with 0 ≤j < l ≤
d −1:
i) Both correct (double reward): If m(j)
k
̸= l and
m(l)
k
̸= j, the condition is satisfied for both qudits. In
this case, a double reward is applied by reducing the cor-
responding exploration parameter according to the rule
w(j,l)
k+1 = r2w(j,l)
k
,
(10)
where r ∈(0, 1) is a parameter referred to as the reward
rate. Furthermore, the three angles in Eq. (5) are set to
zero, so that D(j,l)
k
reduces to the identity operator, i.e.,
D(j,l)
k
= I.
ii) One correct and one incorrect (reward & pun-
ishment):
If m(j)
k
̸= l and m(l)
k
= j, or m(j)
k
= l
and m(l)
k
̸= j, then one qudit satisfies the condition
while the other violates it.
In this case, a mixed re-
ward–punishment update is performed. Specifically, the

4
exploration parameter is updated according to the rule
w(j,l)
k+1 = min(rpw(j,l)
k
, 1),
(11)
where p > 1 is a parameter referred to as the punish-
ment rate. Thus, the exploration parameter decreases if
rp < 1, remains unchanged if rp = 1, and increases if
rp > 1, with the min function preventing it from exceed-
ing 1. The unitary operator D(j,l)
k
is then constructed
as in Eq. (5), with the angles α(j,l)
k
, β(j,l)
k
, and γ(j,l)
k
drawn pseudo-randomly and uniformly within the inter-
val [−πw(j,l)
k
, πw(j,l)
k
].
iii) Both
incorrect
(double
punishment):
If
m(j)
k
= l and m(l)
k
= j, then both qudits violate the
condition. In this case, a double punishment is applied,
with the exploration parameter updated according to the
rule
w(j,l)
k+1 = min(p2w(j,l)
k
, 1).
(12)
The construction of D(j,l)
k
follows the same procedure as
in the case ii).
6. Determination of Dk+1: Once the above proce-
dure has been applied to compute the operators D(j,l)
k
for
all qudit pairs, the operator Dk+1 is obtained from Dk
using Eq. (3).
7. Reset: If the measurement outcome m(j)
k
differs
from j, the unitary |m(j)
k ⟩⟨j|+ |j⟩⟨m(j)
k |+P
l̸=j,m(j)
k |l⟩⟨l| is
applied to the corresponding qudit to reset it to its initial
computational basis state. Once all necessary qudits have
been reinitialized in this way, the algorithm resumes from
step 1 with the iteration index updated to k + 1.
The algorithm described above is said to converge if
all exploration parameters w(j,l)
k
approach zero as the
number of iterations k becomes sufficiently large. In this
case, all the operators D(j,l)
k
tend to the identity, and
the unitary transformation Dk approaches a fixed value.
To determine in practice whether the algorithm has con-
verged, it is useful to introduce a sufficiently small thresh-
old value for the exploration parameter, denoted by wth.
Additionally, we define the maximum exploration param-
eter at iteration k as
w(M)
k
=
max
0≤j<l≤N−1 w(j,l)
k
.
(13)
We say that the algorithm has converged if w(M)
k
< wth
after a certain number of iterations k. A schematic rep-
resentation of the algorithm described above is shown in
Fig. 1.

computational basis C onto the target basis B, under the
assumption that B consists of pure states left invariant by
a certain quantum operation E. If, however, B is not the
only invariant set of pure states under such an operation,
the algorithm may instead converge to a unitary mapping
C onto a different invariant set, rather than the intended
target basis.
To illustrate this point, let us consider the case where
the target basis is formed by the stationary states of a
Hamiltonian H, and the quantum operation E is given
by Eq. (1). In this situation, it is straightforward to ver-
ify that, for certain values of the evolution time τ, pure
states other than the stationary states of H may also re-
main invariant under E. A necessary and sufficient con-
dition for a pure state |Ψ⟩⟨Ψ| to be invariant is that the
survival probability after evolution for a time τ, defined
as
P = ⟨Ψ|U(τ) |Ψ⟩⟨Ψ| U †(τ)|Ψ⟩= | ⟨Ψ|U(τ)|Ψ⟩|2,
(14)
equals unity. Expanding |Ψ⟩in the eigenbasis of H as
|Ψ⟩= Pd−1

with ωα,β = (Eα −Eβ)/ℏ.
According to this expres-
sion, if τ is such that ωα,βτ is an integer multiple of
2π, then sin(ωα,βτ/2) = 0 and any superposition of the
form |Ψ⟩= cα |Φα⟩+ cβ |Φβ⟩remains invariant under E.
However, unless ωα,β = 0 (degenerate eigenvalues), such
states are not true eigenstates of H when both coefficients
cα and cβ are nonzero.
This situation leads to an ambiguity in the learning
dynamics: For certain values of τ, the algorithm cannot

5
reliably distinguish these superpositions from the true
eigenstates based solely on their invariance under the
quantum operation in Eq. (1).
Moreover, the issue is
not limited to cases where ωα,βτ is exactly resonant, i.e.,
an integer multiple of 2π; even when ωα,βτ takes near-
resonant values, the algorithm may struggle to differen-
tiate between genuine eigenstates and spurious invariant
superpositions, potentially leading to convergence toward
an incorrect solution.
Since we do not know a priori whether a fixed τ sat-
isfies this problematic condition, a more robust strategy
is to avoid using the same τ in every iteration. Instead,
a different value of τ is randomly selected at each step
from a suitably chosen interval. In this way, even if cer-
tain τ values prevent the algorithm from distinguishing
some superpositions from true eigenstates, other values
will not, thereby mitigating the occurrence of spurious
eigenstates in the averaged behavior over multiple it-
erations.
For each pair of stationary states with dis-
tinct energies (i.e., ωα,β ̸= 0), the sinusoidal terms in
Eq. (15) have a period 2π/ωα,β, so the longest period
among them is τmax = 2π/ωmin, where ωmin denotes the
smallest nonzero ωα,β. Sampling τ from an interval of
width on the order of τmax—for instance, τ ∈[0, τmax]—
helps to avoid systematic reinforcement of spurious solu-
tions across iterations. If the spectrum of H is unknown,
as is the case in most practical situations, τmax can be
roughly estimated from the characteristic energy scales
of the problem.
E.
Fine-tuning the algorithm after initial
convergence
A way to improve the precision of the algorithm is to
introduce a fine-tuning stage once an initial convergence
has been reached.
Specifically, when the algorithm is
considered to have converged—i.e., when the maximum
exploration parameter satisfies w(M)
k
< wth—all explo-
ration parameters w(j,l)
k
are reset to a new value wr, cho-
sen such that wth < wr < 1. This reinitialization intro-
duces a new phase of exploration while preserving most
of the knowledge already acquired.
The value of wr should be carefully selected: If it is too
close to 1, small errors in the measurements could undo
the learning already achieved. On the other hand, if it is
too close to the threshold wth, the exploration will be too
limited to allow any significant refinement. The optimal
value of wr must be therefore adjusted depending on the
specific problem at hand.
If the reset procedure were applied indefinitely, the al-
gorithm would never reach full convergence.
To avoid
this, the reset value wr is gradually decreased after a fixed
number of iterations. Specifically, once the iteration in-
dex exceeds a predetermined value k0, wr is reduced lin-
early according to the rule wr(kM −k)/(kM −k0), where
kM denotes the maximum number of iterations allowed.
This schedule enables finer exploration after the initial
convergence phase, giving the algorithm the flexibility
to improve the solution while preserving the knowledge
acquired in earlier stages.
F.
Assessing algorithm convergence and accuracy
Two key aspects must be considered when assessing
the performance of the algorithm described above. First,
the number of iterations required to achieve convergence
should be as small as possible, since faster convergence
reflects better algorithmic efficiency. Second, the algo-
rithm must reproduce the target basis states B with high
accuracy, ideally within the minimum number of itera-
tions.
As discussed earlier, convergence can be quantified
through the dependence of the maximum exploration pa-
rameter w(M)
k
on the iteration index k. Regarding accu-
racy, in all the examples considered below the states of
B can be computed independently, without relying on
the algorithm.
This makes it possible to evaluate ac-
curacy directly by calculating the overlaps between the
algorithmic states {Dk |j⟩}j∈{0,...,d−1} and the indepen-
dently obtained vectors of B.
Since it is not known a
priori which vector of the target basis B a given compu-
tational basis state |j⟩will be mapped to, it is necessary
to adopt a flexible accuracy measure. A suitable measure
of the algorithm’s accuracy is provided by the maximum
square-root fidelities, defined for each j ∈{0, . . . , d −1}
as
f (j)
k
=
max
α∈{0,...,d−1} | ⟨Φα|Dk|j⟩|,
(16)
which reflects the best overlap achieved by the trans-
formed state Dk |j⟩with any state of the target basis B
at iteration k.
It is important to note that the algorithm proposed
here explores the space of unitary operators in a stochas-
tic manner. This randomness is twofold: on one hand,
the measurement outcomes in step 4 are intrinsically
probabilistic; on the other hand, the angles α(j,l)
k
, β(j,l)
k
,
and γ(j,l)
k
are generally chosen pseudo-randomly. Conse-
quently, repeated applications of the algorithm generally
produce different instances of Dk, each with varying ac-
curacy. Even when the accuracy is high, in different real-
izations the same computational basis vector |j⟩may be
mapped to different vectors in the target basis B. There-
fore, to properly assess the algorithm’s performance, it is
convenient to consider a sufficiently large set of Nr real-
izations. For each iteration k, the arithmetic means of the
maximum exploration parameter w(M)
k
and the maximum
square-root fidelity f (j)
k
across realizations are computed
and denoted as W (M)
k
and F (j)
k , respectively. These aver-
aged quantities provide a robust way to quantify both the
convergence and accuracy of the algorithm over multiple
stochastic realizations.

6
In what follows, we test the convergence and accuracy
of the proposed algorithm by applying it to the calcu-
lation of the eigenstates of several representative Hamil-
tonian models. For this purpose, all Hamiltonians are
rescaled to a dimensionless form,
˜H =
H −EminI
Emax −Emin
,
(17)
where Emin and Emax are the minimum and maximum
eigenenergies of H, respectively.
This guarantees that
the spectrum of ˜H lies between 0 and 1, with the low-
est eigenvalue equal to 0 and the highest equal to 1.
In addition, we define a dimensionless evolution time as
˜τ = τ(Emax −Emin)/ℏ, so that the time parameter nat-
urally adapts to the spectral range of the Hamiltonian.
To avoid convergence of the algorithm to spurious eigen-
states, instead of keeping τ (or its dimensionless version
˜τ) fixed, at each iteration we randomly select its value
within a suitable interval, as described in Sec. II D.

Testing the algorithm on random Hamiltonians
To provide an initial illustration of the proposed algo-
rithm, we apply it to the calculation of the eigenvectors
of random Hamiltonians. In each realization, a different
Hermitian matrix with randomly chosen complex entries
is generated, and the associated Hamiltonian is rescaled
according to Eq. (17). The algorithm is then executed
for a sufficient number of iterations to ensure conver-
gence, and the obtained states are compared with the
exact eigenvectors computed by direct diagonalization,
using the fidelities defined in Eq. (16). Repeating this
procedure over Nr realizations finally allows us to com-
pute the mean fidelities F (j)
k
and the mean maximum
exploration parameter W (M)
k
.
Figure 2 shows the results obtained for a two-qubit
system (d = 4). Panels (a) and (b) display the behavior
of F (j)
k
and W (M)
k
as a function of the iteration number k
without the reset mechanism described in Sec. II E, while
panels (c) and (d) show the corresponding results when
the reset is applied. In both cases, in each iteration the
dimensionless evolution time ˜τ was uniformly sampled
from the interval [0, 100] to avoid the issue discussed in
Sec. II D. The remaining parameters are set to r = 0.9,
p = 2/r, wth = 0.005, wr = 0.01, and Nr = 100. The
fidelities corresponding to the four possible states of the
computational basis are represented in different colors.
However, since the curves largely overlap, the colors can-
not be easily distinguished.
As shown in Fig. 2, the algorithm attains high fideli-
ties both with and without the reset mechanism, with a
slight improvement when resets are applied. After con-
vergence, the maximum and minimum fidelities across
the computational basis states are nearly identical: with-
out resets Fmax ≈Fmin ≈0.97, whereas with resets
Fmax ≈Fmin ≈0.98. The average number of iterations
required for convergence is lower in the absence of resets,
since the reset scheme necessarily introduces additional
stages of exploration and, consequently, a higher number
of iterations.

as functions of the
iteration number k without the reset mechanism described in
Sec. II E, while panels (c) and (d) show the results with reset.
Each realization uses a different random Hamiltonian, and in
each iteration the dimensionless evolution time ˜τ is uniformly
sampled from [0, 100].
Parameters are r = 0.9, p = 2/r,
wth = 0.005, wr = 0.01, and Nr = 100.
Fidelities for the
four computational basis states are plotted in different colors;
however, because the curves largely overlap, the colors are
difficult to distinguish. In the left panels, dashed horizontal
lines indicate the maximum and minimum fidelities, Fmax and
Fmin.
In Fig. 3, we present results analogous to those in
Fig. 2, but for a three-qubit system (d = 8). The re-
set mechanism described in Sec. II E substantially im-
proves the fidelities, increasing them from Fmin ≈0.90
and Fmax ≈0.91 without resets to Fmin ≈0.97 and
Fmax ≈0.98 with resets. While this improvement comes
with an increase in the number of iterations required
for convergence, the reset scheme consistently guides
the algorithm toward high-quality results across all basis
states, demonstrating its effectiveness in larger systems.
Random Hamiltonians of the type considered in this
section have also been studied in the literature using a
reinforcement learning algorithm different from the one
presented here (see Ref. [34]). Providing a detailed de-
scription of the protocol of Ref. [34] is beyond the scope
of this work.
Nevertheless, although both approaches
use measurement outcomes as the basis for reward and
punishment, there are fundamental differences between
the two reinforcement learning strategies. In particular,
while the method of Ref. [34] searches for eigenstates se-
quentially, starting from an arbitrarily chosen one, our
approach is designed to learn all eigenstates simultane-

(d = 8). All parameters are identical to those used for the two-
qubit case shown in Fig. 2, except for the increased Hilbert-
space dimension.
ously.
When comparing the results presented here with those
of Ref. [34] for the two-qubit case—the only one reported
in that work—we observe that our algorithm achieves
slightly higher fidelities across the full set of states. In the
method of Ref. [34], some states are obtained with high
accuracy, whereas others perform less favorably. This dif-
ference may be related to the fact that, in our approach,
all states are treated on equal footing, while in the other
method some states are obtained earlier in the sequen-
tial procedure.
Another important aspect is that the
number of iterations required for convergence is signifi-
cantly smaller in our algorithm. In fact, when attempt-
ing to extend the protocol of Ref. [34] to three qubits, we
found that convergence could be reached for some states,
but obtaining convergence for all of them within a rea-
sonable number of iterations proved challenging. In the
next section, we apply the present algorithm to paradig-
matic physical Hamiltonians, including the transverse-
field Ising model (TFIM) and Richardson pairing Hamil-
tonian, to demonstrate its robustness and versatility be-
yond random systems.
III.
APPLICATION TO PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
In this section, we apply the method proposed above to
two types of physical systems. The first, relevant to con-
densed matter physics, is the TFIM [74], which is com-
monly used to describe condensed matter systems and
has also frequently served as a benchmark in quantum
computing studies. Assuming only nearest-neighbor in-
teractions, the TFIM Hamiltonian can be written as [75]
H = −J
N−2
X
j=0
ZjZj+1 −h
N−1
X
j=0
Xj −K
N−2
X
j=0
XjZj+1. (18)
Here j ∈{0, · · · , N −1} labels the N qubits, {Xj, Yj, Zj}
denotes the set of associated Pauli matrices, and J, h,
and K are parameters with dimensions of energy.
The second model is the pairing Hamiltonian, also
known as the Richardson Hamiltonian [76–79], which is
often used to describe small superfluid systems, such as
atomic nuclei. Here, we focus on the specific subspace
with seniority zero (no pair breaking) and employ the
pair-to-qubit encoding technique. In this encoding, the
Hamiltonian reads [80]
H =
N−1
X
j=0

εj −g


(I −Zj) −g

N−1
X
j=1
j−1
X
k=0
(XjXk + YjYk) ,
(19)
where εi and g are parameters with dimensions of en-
ergy, representing the single-particle energy levels and
the interaction strength, respectively. In the following,
we assume equidistant single-particle levels, εj = j∆ε,
with ∆ε denoting the energy spacing between levels.
Both models share the feature of exhibiting a quan-
tum phase transition (QPT). In the TFIM, the transi-
tion occurs from ordered to disordered spin orientations,
whereas in the pairing model it corresponds to a U(1)
symmetry-breaking transition associated with particle-
number conservation.
Beyond the presence of QPTs,
however, the two models represent very different physical
systems, both in nature and in their quantum informa-
tion content. Specifically, the TFIM involves only local
interactions and is generally characterized by area-law
entanglement, while the pairing model features all-to-all
interactions and is typically associated with volume-law
entanglement.
In the following subsections, we present the results
obtained by implementing the algorithm on these two
models. As in the case of the random Hamiltonians an-
alyzed earlier, both the TFIM and pairing Hamiltonians
will first be rescaled to dimensionless form according to
Eq. (17). In addition, at each iteration the dimensionless
time ˜τ will be randomly sampled within an appropriate
interval, as described in Sec. II D, to prevent convergence
to spurious eigenstates.
A.
Application to the TFIM model
To evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm when ap-
plied to the TFIM Hamiltonian, we first analyze the
mean fidelities F (j)
k
shown in the left panels of Fig. 4.
In these simulations, following the procedure described
in Sec. II D, the dimensionless propagation time ˜τ is
randomly sampled at each iteration within the inter-
val [0, 600] to prevent convergence to spurious station-
ary states.
In addition, the reset mechanism outlined

8
in Sec. II E is applied with parameters wth = 0.005
and wr = 0.01.
As shown in the figure, a slight de-
crease in both the maximum and minimum fidelities is
observed as the number of qubits increases: Fmax = 0.996
and Fmin = 0.993 for two qubits, Fmax = 0.988 and
Fmin = 0.985 for three qubits, and Fmax = 0.968 and
Fmin = 0.961 for four qubits. This reduction in fidelities
is expected, as increasing the number of qubits exponen-
tially enlarges the dimension of the Hilbert space, making
the exploration of the state space more challenging.
In the right panels of Fig. 4, we show, for each stochas-
tic realization and for each computational basis state |j⟩,
the expectation values of the dimensionless TFIM Hamil-
tonian after the algorithm has converged, plotted against
the index assigned to each realization. Specifically, for
sufficiently large values of k such that the algorithm has
effectively converged, we represent
⟨˜H⟩j = ⟨j|D†
k ˜HDk|j⟩
(20)
for each j ∈{0, . . . , d −1} and for each realization,
with ˜H given by Eq. (17) using the TFIM Hamiltonian
of Eq. (18). The solid horizontal lines indicate the ex-
act values obtained via numerical diagonalization of the
Hamiltonian.
As can be seen, for the two- and three-
qubit cases, the energies obtained in most realizations
match the exact numerical values quite closely. This in-
dicates that, in these cases, even a single realization is
sufficient to approximate the full set of eigenstates. For
four qubits, however, deviations become more noticeable,
even though the fidelities are only slightly lower than in
the smaller systems. This highlights that the computa-
tion of these energies is highly sensitive to small varia-
tions in the stationary states approximated by the algo-
rithm.
In an effort to improve the estimation of the eigenen-
ergies, we slightly modified the algorithm parameters.
Specifically, in Fig. 5 we show the same results as in
Fig. 4, but using a slightly higher reward parameter,
r = 0.93. Compared to Fig. 4, this adjustment of the
reward parameter generally leads to a modest improve-
ment in both the fidelities and the estimated energies,
indicating that small changes in the algorithm settings
can enhance the accuracy of the results across all realiza-
tions.
It should be noted that the example discussed above
represents an ideal benchmark, as the performance of
the algorithm can be directly assessed by comparing its
output with the exact stationary states and eigenener-
gies obtained through numerical diagonalization of the
Hamiltonian. In more realistic scenarios, however, such
exact information may not be available, making it impos-
sible to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm in a di-
rect manner. Nevertheless, for the eigenenergies, it is still
possible to identify, among all stochastic realizations of
the algorithm, those providing the best approximations
to the ground and highest-energy states. Specifically, the
realizations yielding the smallest and largest expectation
values of the Hamiltonian can be associated with these

tonian in Eq. (18) with J/h = 1 and K/h = 0.5. The remain-
ing parameters are r = 0.9, p = 2/r, wth = 0.005, wr = 0.05,
and Nr = 50. In each iteration, the dimensionless evolution
time ˜τ is uniformly sampled from [0, 600]. The upper panels
[(a) and (b)] correspond to the two-qubit case (d = 4), the
middle panels [(c) and (d)] to three qubits (d = 8), and the
lower panels [(e) and (f)] to four qubits (d = 16). In the left

two states, respectively.
This identification is justified
by the variational principle, which states that the expec-
tation value of the Hamiltonian in any normalized state
constitutes an upper bound to the exact ground-state
energy. Likewise, applying the same argument to the in-
verted Hamiltonian, −H, the expectation value provides
a lower bound to the highest-energy eigenvalue.
Con-
sequently, the realizations corresponding to the smallest
and largest energy expectations offer the most accurate
approximations to the ground and highest-energy states,
respectively. Later, we will introduce a more general cri-
terion based on evaluating the energy dispersions of the

states obtained from the different realizations of the al-
gorithm.
B.
Application to the pairing model
We now consider the pairing Hamiltonian given by
Eq. (19). This Hamiltonian describes a set of interact-
ing particle pairs and is relevant for modeling the tran-
sition from normal to superfluid phases in small super-
conducting systems. Notably, while in the TFIM model
the exact solution required the diagonalization of a d × d
matrix, here the Hamiltonian exhibits a block-diagonal
structure in the computational qubit basis due to par-
ticle number conservation.
Specifically, after applying
the particle-to-qubit transformation leading to Eq. (19),
particle number conservation is mapped onto the conser-
vation of the Hamming weight.
Starting from a given
basis state |j⟩, we can equivalently write it in the qubit
basis as |[j]⟩, where [j] denotes the binary representa-
tion of j. The Hamming weight is defined as the num-
ber of “1”s in [j]. In the pairing Hamiltonian, two basis
states |j⟩and |k⟩have non-zero Hamiltonian matrix ele-
ments only if they share the same Hamming weight. Con-
sequently, the block corresponding to Hamming weight
NHam has dimension CNHam
N
, the binomial coefficient (“N
choose NHam”), which counts the number of ways to
choose NHam objects out of N.
This block structure

tonian in Eq. (19) with εj = j∆ε and g/∆ε = 1. The remain-

and Nr = 50. In each iteration, the dimensionless evolution
time ˜τ is uniformly sampled from [0, 600].
Panels (a)–(b)

Fmin. The right panels display, for each computational-basis

is commonly exploited in classical computations to ac-
cess eigenstates by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian within
each block. In the context of machine learning, however,
exploiting problem symmetries can introduce additional
challenges. Here, one of our objectives is to test whether
the RL method can converge to the correct energies with-

10
out explicitly enforcing these symmetries during learning.
Figure 6 presents results analogous to those in Fig. 4,
but for the pairing Hamiltonian instead of the TFIM
model.
The left panels display the mean fidelities for
each computational-basis state |j⟩, averaged over all
stochastic realizations, as a function of the iteration num-
ber.
The right panels show, for each realization and
computational-basis state, the expectation values of the
dimensionless pairing Hamiltonian obtained after the al-
gorithm has converged, compared with the exact eigenen-
ergies from numerical diagonalization.
The results are
shown for increasing numbers of qubits, from N = 2
to N = 5.
The coupling strength parameter is set to
g/∆ε = 1, corresponding to the strong-coupling regime
that gives rise to the superfluid phase. Accordingly, the
eigenstates generally involve complex superpositions of
the original basis states. However, there are two particu-
lar computational basis states, |0⟩and |d −1⟩, which cor-
respond to Hamming weights NHam = 0 and NHam = N,
respectively, and are exact eigenstates of the pairing
Hamiltonian. Consequently, two horizontal lines with fi-
delity equal to 1 appear in the left panels of the figure,
and the maximum fidelity is therefore always 1 in those
plots.
Although the properties of the pairing Hamiltonian dif-
fer substantially from those of the TFIM model, we again
observe that, after a reasonable number of iterations, the
algorithm achieves very good fidelities in most cases, with
the exception of the four-qubit system. As seen in the left
panels, the mean fidelities remain high overall, although
the minimum fidelity tends to decrease as the number
of qubits increases.
This trend is expected, since the
dimension of the Hilbert space grows exponentially with
the system size, making the exploration of the state space
increasingly demanding. This behavior is consistent with
the results shown in the right panels, where the expec-
tation values of the dimensionless Hamiltonian are gen-
erally very close to the exact eigenenergies across nearly
all realizations. An exception occurs for N = 4, where
two distinct groups of fidelities appear in panel (e): one
set converging close to unity and another slightly above
0.9, resulting in a minimum fidelity smaller than that for
N = 5. This apparent inconsistency with the accurate
reproduction of the eigenenergies [panel (f)] can be ex-
plained by the presence of an exact degeneracy in one
of the eigenenergies. Within the corresponding degen-
erate subspace, the eigenstates are not uniquely defined,
and the algorithm may converge to different linear combi-
nations than those obtained from direct diagonalization,
leading to slightly reduced fidelities. Nevertheless, the
method performs well for N = 4, successfully recovering
the correct set of eigenenergies.
For N = 5 [panels (g) and (h)], three distinct groups
of curves appear, all reaching high fidelities but requiring
different numbers of iterations to converge. In the final
iterations, the expectation values of the dimensionless
Hamiltonian remain reasonably close to the exact ener-
gies, though the comparison becomes less straightforward
due to the increased density of states.
The emergence of multiple convergence rates arises
from the symmetry structure of the pairing Hamiltonian,
which organizes the Hilbert space into blocks of differ-
ent sizes according to particle-number conservation. In
the qubit representation, these blocks correspond to sub-
spaces with fixed Hamming weight. For five qubits, there
are two blocks of size 1 (NHam = 0 and NHam = 5), two
of size 5 (NHam = 1 and NHam = 4), and two of size
10 (NHam = 2 and NHam = 3). The cases NHam = 0
and NHam = 5 correspond to the exact eigenstates |0⟩
and |31⟩, explaining the horizontal lines with fidelity one
in panel (g). The groups of curves that converge faster
correspond to the blocks of size 5, while the slower con-
vergence is associated with the larger blocks of size 10.
This behavior reflects that the number of iterations re-
quired for convergence increases with the dimension of
the explored subspace. It is worth noting that the algo-
rithm manages to converge within all symmetry sectors
without being provided with any prior information about
the underlying symmetries.
C.
Symmetry-restricted RL
We showed in the previous section that the RL pro-
tocol introduced here is able to capture the symmetries
of a Hamiltonian without prior knowledge of them. Al-
ternatively, if the symmetries of the system are known in
advance, the RL protocol can be directly applied within a
given symmetry sector. Exploiting such symmetries can
effectively extend the applicability of the RL technique to
systems with a larger number of qubits, since each sector
has a lower dimension than the full Hilbert space.
To illustrate the above-mentioned procedure, we first
consider the case N = 5 shown in panels (g) and (h) of
Fig. 6. To account for particle-number conservation, in-
stead of performing the RL in the full Hilbert space of
dimension d = 25 = 32, we apply the RL algorithm sepa-
rately within sectors of states |j⟩whose Hamming weight
takes a fixed value between 0 and 5. Panels (a) and (b)
of Fig. 7 show the results obtained from the indepen-
dent symmetry-restricted calculations corresponding to
each Hamming-weight sector: NHam = 0 (d = C0
5 = 1),
NHam = 1 (d = C1
5 = 5), NHam = 2 (d = C2
5 = 10),
NHam = 3 (d = C3
5 = 10), NHam = 4 (d = C4
5 = 5), and
NHam = 5 (d = C5
5 = 1). Since the dimension of each of
these sectors is smaller than that of the full Hilbert space,
the application of the algorithm becomes less demanding.
This figure also confirms our previous interpretation that
the different convergence scales observed earlier originate
from the different dimensions of the symmetry sectors.
In order to highlight the advantages of this approach,
panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 7 show the results of applying
the symmetry-restricted RL algorithm to a larger system
with N = 6 qubits. The fact that some sectors display
lower fidelity values does not necessarily indicate a fail-
ure of the algorithm. This behavior is analogous to that

11
FIG. 7. Results of the symmetry-restricted RL algorithm ap-
plied to the pairing Hamiltonian.
The left panels display,
for each computational-basis state, the mean fidelities as a
function of the iteration number, while the right panels show,
for each state and realization, the dimensionless expectation
values of the energies obtained after the stochastic process
has converged. Different colors represent the results obtained
for the different Hamming-weight sectors. Panels (a) and (b)
correspond to the five-qubit system (N = 5) shown in panels
(g) and (h) of Fig. 6, but with the RL applied independently
within each Hamming-weight sector. Panels (c) and (d) show
analogous results for a six-qubit system (N = 6). All param-
eter values are the same as in Fig. 6, except for the number
of realizations, which is Nr = 20 in this case.
observed for the four-qubit case in panel (e) of Fig. 6.
In the present case, several eigenenergies are degenerate,
and within each degenerate subspace, the eigenstates are
not uniquely defined. As a result, the algorithm may con-
verge to linear combinations of these degenerate eigen-
states that differ from those obtained by direct diago-
nalization, leading to reduced fidelities without implying
incorrect convergence.
D.
Post-selection of “good” final states
An interesting aspect illustrated by the previous figures
is the dispersion of the final expectation values of the di-
mensionless Hamiltonian observed among different real-
izations. Even though the mean fidelities are high, these
expectation values may differ noticeably from the exact
eigenenergies from one realization to another. Similarly,
the fidelities of the final states also fluctuate between
realizations, despite the relatively high mean value. A
natural question that arises is how to determine whether
the results obtained in a specific realization are good or
bad. The fidelities associated with that realization can-
not serve as a criterion, since they could only be com-
puted if the exact eigenstates were already known. More-
over, as previously discussed, low fidelities do not neces-
sarily imply poor convergence to the eigenstates in the
FIG. 8. Illustration of the evaluation of the energy fluctua-
tions defined in Eq. (21). This quantity is computed for each
final state and plotted as a function of the realization num-
ber. The results correspond to the final states obtained for
the pairing Hamiltonian with N = 5 qubits, as in panels (g)
and (h) of Fig. 6 and panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 7. All param-
eter values are the same as in those figures. The horizontal
dashed line indicates the threshold value σth = 0.02, which is
used to select the final states shown in Fig. 10.

presence of degeneracies. As an alternative, one can con-

and realization as

k ˜HDk|j⟩2,

where k is chosen large enough for the algorithm to have
converged. Indeed, this quantity is always non-negative
and vanishes only when the state is an exact eigenstate.

are shown in the energy-versus-realization plot. The results
correspond to the N = 5 pairing Hamiltonian, using the same
data as in Fig. 8.

appreciated by comparison with panel (f) of Fig. 6, where all

energy fluctuations computed for the states obtained at
the end of the learning process with the pairing Hamil-
tonian for the case of N = 5 qubits. The results corre-
spond to the same parameter set used in panels (g) and
(h) of Fig. 6 and panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 7. The figure
clearly shows that the fluctuation values exhibit a rather
wide dispersion among the different computational-basis
states, even within a single realization.
It is to be expected that, for a given state, smaller
energy fluctuations indicate a closer convergence to an
eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. To further illustrate this,
Fig. 9 shows the average distance between the expecta-
tion value ⟨˜H⟩j and the closest eigenenergy of the dimen-
sionless pairing Hamiltonian as a function of a threshold
value σth. The average is taken over all final states and
realizations from Fig. 8 that satisfy σj ≤σth, while error
bars denote statistical deviations across the selected real-
izations and states. As observed, the smaller the thresh-
old σth, the smaller the distance between the expectation
values and the exact eigenenergies. This observation mo-
tivates the introduction of a fluctuation threshold σth to
post-select the most reliable final states.
To illustrate that energy fluctuations can be used as
a post-selection criterion to identify “good” final states,
we present in Fig. 10 the final expectation values of the
dimensionless Hamiltonian, retaining only those states
whose energy fluctuations fall below a chosen threshold,
σth = 0.02. Even when the RL algorithm has not fully
converged for all states within a given realization, this se-
lection allows us to isolate the most reliable results. The
expectation values obtained from the selected final states
show a much better agreement with the exact eigenener-
gies than those displayed in panel (f) of Fig. 6, where all
final states were included. This confirms that imposing
a fluctuation-based selection efficiently filters out poorly
converged states while preserving those that faithfully
reproduce the true eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we have introduced a RL-based algo-
rithm designed to identify the unitary transformation
that maps the computational basis onto the set of pure
states that remain invariant under the action of a given
quantum operation. A key feature of this approach is its
ability to determine all these states simultaneously and
the way it constructs the global unitary transformation
iteratively from two-qudit operations guided by a rein-
forcement strategy.
To benchmark the algorithm, we considered the prob-
lem of finding the eigenstates of specific Hamiltoni-
ans.
For pseudo-random Hamiltonians involving two-
and three-qubit systems, the method achieved high fi-
delities across multiple stochastic realizations, confirming
its robustness and accuracy. We then applied the algo-
rithm to two physical models: the TFIM and the pair-
ing Hamiltonian. In the TFIM case, high fidelities were
maintained as the number of qubits increased from two
to four, demonstrating the scalability of the approach.
For the pairing Hamiltonian, reliable convergence was
obtained for systems of up to six qubits, although some
states exhibited slightly lower fidelities due to the larger
Hilbert-space dimension and the presence of degenera-
cies.
A remarkable feature of the algorithm is its ability to
uncover the underlying symmetries of the system without
prior knowledge. This manifests in the appearance of dif-
ferent convergence time scales associated with symmetry
sectors of varying sizes. Moreover, by explicitly restrict-
ing the learning process to subspaces of fixed Hamming
weight, we verified that the algorithm correctly identi-
fies the eigenstates within each symmetry block. Such
restriction also makes the computation significantly less
demanding, as the effective dimensionality of the learning
space is reduced.
We also introduced a post-selection criterion based on
the energy fluctuations of the final states, which allows
one to identify well-converged (“good”) results even when
the RL process has not fully converged for all states. Ap-
plying a threshold on these fluctuations efficiently filters
out poorly converged states, yielding a set of results that
almost perfectly reproduce the exact eigenenergies.
Although in this work we have focused on unitary
quantum operations, the structure of the algorithm is not
limited to this case. Its formulation naturally extends to
non-unitary dynamics, making it a promising tool for in-
vestigating dissipative or open quantum systems. Future
work will explore this extension and, in particular, the
case where the fixed points of the quantum operation are
not pure states forming an orthonormal basis.
