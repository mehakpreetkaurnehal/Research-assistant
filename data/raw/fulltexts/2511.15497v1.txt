ABSTRACT
Cavitation intensity recognition (CIR) is a critical technology for detecting and evaluating cavitation
phenomena in hydraulic machinery, with significant implications for operational safety, performance
optimization, and maintenance cost reduction in complex industrial systems. Despite substantial
research progress, a comprehensive review that systematically traces the development trajectory
and provides explicit guidance for future research is still lacking. To bridge this gap, this paper
presents a thorough review and analysis of hundreds of publications on intelligent CIR across various
types of mechanical equipment from 2002 to 2025, summarizing its technological evolution and
offering insights for future development. The early stages are dominated by traditional machine
learning approaches that relied on manually engineered features under the guidance of domain expert
knowledge. The advent of deep learning has driven the development of end-to-end models capable
of automatically extracting features from multi-source signals, thereby significantly improving
recognition performance and robustness. Recently, physical informed diagnostic models have been
proposed to embed domain knowledge into deep learning models, which can enhance interpretability
and cross-condition generalization. In the future, transfer learning, multi-modal fusion, lightweight
network architectures, and the deployment of industrial agents are expected to propel CIR technology
into a new stage, addressing challenges in multi-source data acquisition, standardized evaluation, and
industrial implementation. The paper aims to systematically outline the evolution of CIR technology
and highlight the emerging trend of integrating deep learning with physical knowledge. This provides
a significant reference for researchers and practitioners in the field of intelligent cavitation diagnosis
in complex industrial systems.

Introduction
Cavitation intensity recognition (CIR) is a critical technology for quantitatively evaluating cavitation phenomena
occurring during the operation of hydraulic machinery [1]. Cavitation not only generates intense noise and vibration,
but can also cause erosion on equipment component surfaces, performance degradation and structural failure, posing
severe threats to the safety, stability and cost-effectiveness of industrial systems [2]. The high performance of CIR
enables timely implementation of control measures, optimization of operating conditions, extension of equipment
service lift and reduction of maintenance and downtime costs. Therefore, CIR holds significant engineering importance
and practical relevance across sectors including energy, shipping, aerospace and chemical industrial, where pumps,
turbines, propellers and valves serve as critical components [3]. With the advancement of sensing technology and
the improvement of data acquisition capabilities, multi-source signals (e.g. acoustic, vibration, pressure, high-speed
imaging, etc.) provide abundant diagnostic information for CIR, which has driven increasing attention from both
academic and industry over the past two decades.
Intelligent cavitation intensity recognition (ICIR) represents a methodology that applies machine learning and deep
learning from modern artificial intelligence techniques to cavitation intensity recognition [4]. Unlike traditional
diagnostic approaches reliant on manual feature extraction and expert experience, ICIR can adaptively learn from
complex multi-source sensor data. It can automatically capture cavitation features and establish a mapping between
signals and cavitation intensity, which significantly reduces dependence on human intervention [5]. Firstly, it can process
multi-modal information, enabling comprehensive cross-signal-type analysis and improving diagnostic performance
and robustness. Secondly, it holds the capability to handle non-linear, multi-scale and high-noise signals, adapting to
recognition requirements across various equipment types and operating condition. Thirdly, it achieves an automated
workflow from raw data to recognition results through an end-to-end model, reducing diagnostic time and enhancing
real-time monitoring capabilities. Fourthly, it can incorporate physical knowledge embedding and constraint loss
methods to improve model interpretability and cross-condition generalization, which provides technical support for
sustainable monitoring and predictive maintenance in industrial scenarios.
In recent years, ICIR has attracted increasing attention from both academic and industry, a trend closely related to the
rapid development of machine learning technologies. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the technological
evolution and research dynamics in this field, we have conducted a systematic statistical analysis of several hundred
relevant publications from 2002 to 2025, as shown in Figure 1. This analysis aims to reveal the principal technical
characteristics and developmental trends of each stage, which provides a basis for the division of subsequent research
phases. Based on the observed changes in publication with technological advancement characteristics, we roughly
divide the research of CIR into three periods as follows.
In the past, traditional machine learning (TML) methods served as the primary technical approach in CIR. These
methods typically relied on manually engineered features extracted from acoustic, vibration or pressure signals by
domain experts. These features are classified using classical algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM) [6],
decision trees (DT) [7], artificial neural networks (ANN) [8], k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) [9] and expert systems
(ES) [10]. This stage of development reduced reliance on purely manual judgement, but feature construction remains
time-consuming and labor-intensive and heavily dependent on expert experience. This leads to limited generalization
capabilities across different operating conditions.
In the present, the rise of deep learning has driven ICIR into the era of end-to-end modeling. The deep learning models
can automatically capture cavitation features directly from multi-source raw signals (e.g. acoustic, vibration, pressure,
high-speed imaging, etc.) and also perform multi-modal information fusion to enhance recognition performance
and robustness. The application of deep belief networks (DBN) [11], convolutional neural networks (CNN) [12],
residual neural networks (ResNet) [13], dense convolutional networks (DenseNet) [14], MobileNet [15], ShuffleNet
[16], recurrent neural networks (RNN) [17], long short-term memory (LSTM) [18], gated recurrent neural networks
(GRU) [19] and Transformer [20] architectures has significantly improved the real-time performance and stability of
CIR under complex operating conditions.
In the future, the development of ICIR will depend on standardized high-quality multi-source data acquisition and the
design of physical informed deep learning diagnostic models. Through incorporating physical mechanisms, physical
knowledge embedding and physical constraint losses into end-to-end data-driven deep learning, which can enhance the
physical consistency of the model [21]. This approach not only helps improve the model’s generalization capabilities
under small-sample, high-noise and cross-operating conditions, but also significantly enhances the interpretability
and engineering credibility of the diagnostic results [22, 23]. Compared to purely data-driven methods, physical-
informed diagnostic models can better capture the non-linear, multi-scale characteristics of cavitation processes,
ensuring diagnostic outputs are closely aligned with practical physical mechanisms [24]. In addition, in future industrial
applications, the combination of real-time data acquisition by the industrial internet of things and edge computing

deployment will enable physical informed deep learning diagnostic models to provide robust support for ICIR across
equipment and operating conditions [25, 26].
To summarize the research of CIR, Wu at al. [1] discussed various methods for characterizing cavitation intensity
and emphasizes three acoustic approaches. Liu et al. [27] analyzed pump cavitation detection methods based various
signals and discussed future trends with intelligent algorithms and advanced sensing. Adil et al. [28] examined
experimental methods and control systems for diagnosing and managing cavitation in centrifugal pumps, and proposed
future improvements using more sensors, advanced data processing and artificial intelligence for early detection to
enhance reliability and extend service life. Fernández et al. [29] outlined acoustic emission techniques for cavitation
and fracture detection in hydraulic turbines and emphasized artificial intelligent as a key future direction for condition
monitoring. Mousmoulis et al. [30] discussed cavitation monitoring tools for centrifugal pumps and advocated for
developing reliable, low-cost and easy-to-install multi-sensor setups. Folden et al. [31] categorized cavitation models,
analyzed key examples and outlined future improvements in flow simulation. Existing reviews on CIR have the
following shortcomings. Firstly, the previous reviews just focus on a single technical approach or specific equipment
type (e.g. pumps, turbines, acoustic detection, modeling methods, etc.) and lacks a systematic and integrated framework
across different methods and devices, which makes it difficult to comprehensively compare their feasibility and cost-
effectiveness. Secondly, these reviews typically cover only specific stage of CIR development, lacking a systematic
overview that integrates past, present and future progress. Thirdly, the current reviews generally do not provide a
roadmap for the future development of CIR, while potential research trends over the next five to ten years are of great
interest to review readers. Fourthly, the present reviews provide limited coverage of emerging technologies such as
deep learning and physical informed deep learning.
In order to overcome the above shortcomings, this paper systematically examines hundreds of studies across various
hydraulic machinery from 2002 to 2025 and outlines a technological roadmap for this field. The contributions of this
review are summarized as follows:
• The development of CIR is organized into three stages: past traditional machine learning, present deep learning
and future physical informed deep learning, which helps systematically trace the technological evolution,
clarify the key characteristics of each stage and provide guidance for future research directions.
• A future roadmap for CIR is proposed, highlighting physical-informed diagnostic models, multi-modal fusion,
lightweight network architectures and industrial agents deployment as promising directions to overcome
challenges in multi-source data acquisition, standardized evaluation and industrial implementation.
• A systemic view of CIR’s technological evolution is presented and the trend of integrating deep learning
with physical knowledge is emphasized, providing a valuable reference for intelligent cavitation diagnosis in
complex industrial systems.
The rest of this review is organized as follows. Section 2 examines the past development of CIR, focusing on the
applications of traditional machine learning theories. Section 3 reviews the applications of deep learning theories,
representing the present period in the development of CIR. Section 4 argues applications of physical informed deep
learning to CIR. In Section 5, a roadmap is outlined in conjunction with the challenges of CIR. Conclusions are provided
in Section 6.

Traditional Machine Learning
Traditionally, cavitation intensity recognition (CIR) has primarily relied on operators’ experience-based judgment of
equipment operating conditions and on-site inspections [27, 30]. It not only increase maintenance workload but also
affects the performance and consistency of diagnostic results. In recent years, with the continuous development of sensor
technology and signal processing methods, researchers have gradually introduced traditional machine learning (TML)
into CIR tasks, achieving automated prediction and recognition of cavitation states [32, 33]. A typical TML-based
CIR includes four key steps: data acquisition, feature extraction, feature selection and intelligent intensity recognition
[34, 35], see Figure 2. Each step will be discussed in the following subsections.
2.1
Data Acquisition
During the data acquisition phase, sensors are typically installed at critical locations on equipment (e.g. valves
[36, 37], pipes [38, 39], pumps [40, 41], turbines [42, 43] and propellers [44, 45]) to enable continuous monitoring of
operational conditions. Researchers employ various types of sensors to effectively capture the formation, development
and associated physical changes of cavitation bubbles. Different types of sensors have their own advantages in terms
of adaptability, sensitivity, resolution and anti-interference capability [30, 46], see Table 1. In general, pumps, valves,

pipes and turbines commonly utilize vibration, acoustic and pressure sensors [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52], while propellers
mainly use acoustic, pressure, current and high-speed sensors [53, 54]. By appropriately selecting and integrating
multi-source sensor data, the performance and robustness of CIR can be significantly improved.

2.2
Feature Extraction
Feature extraction serves as a crucial bridge between raw sensor signals and TML models in CIR. By analysing the
time-domain, frequency-domain and time-frequency-domain characteristics of the signals, multi-dimensional features
that effectively represent the cavitation state can be extracted [55, 56, 57], as detailed below.
• Time-domain features: These are statistical quantities directly derived from the raw signal, including mean,
variance, kurtosis, skewness, maximum value, minimum value, shape factor, peak factor, clearance factor,
impulse factor, etc., reflecting the overall fluctuation characteristics of the signal [58, 59].
• Frequency-domain features: These are obtained from the frequency spectrum, including mean frequency,
frequency center, frequency standard deviation, root mean square frequency, spectral entropy, energy spectral
density, etc., which help capture frequency variations caused by cavitation [60].
• Time-frequency-domain features: These are suitable for non-stationary signal analysis, common methods
include wavelet transform, wavelet packet transform, short-time Fourier transform and empirical model
decomposition [61, 62, 63]. These approaches enable the characteristics of the dynamic evolution of cavitation
across different time scales.

2.3
Feature Selection
Feature selection aims to filter out a discriminative and sensitive feature subset from high-dimensional features, reducing
computational complexity, alleviating the dimension diaster and improving recognition performance [64, 65]. For CIR
task, commonly used feature selection methods include filter-based, wrapper-based, embedded-based and reduction-
based approaches, each of which has its own advantages and is suitable for different data scenarios and modeling
requirements.
2.3.1
Filter-based Methods
Filter-based methods evaluate the correlation or statistical properties between each feature and the target variable,
performing feature selection independently before the model training [66]. The following briefly introduces several
commonly used filters.
• Variance threshold [67]: Remove features with low variance and low information content to enhance general-
ization ability of the model.
• Correlation coefficient analysis [68]: Calculate the linear or non-linear correlation between features and target
variable (e.g. Pearson, Spearman or Kendall coefficients, etc.)
• Mutual information [69]: Measure the non-linear dependency between features and target variable, which is
suitable for feature selection under complex distribution structures.
• Distance Evaluation [70]: Based on the principle of minimizing intra-class distance and maximizing inter-class
distance, features with strong class discrimination capabilities are selected.
• Information gain and gain ratio [71]: Evaluate the effective amount of information carried by a feature. Features
with higher information gain and gain ratio are generally more advantageous in enhancing the performance of
diagnostic models.
• Minimum redundancy maximum relevance [72]: Select the most representative feature subset by maximizing
the relevance between features and the target variable and minimizing redundancy among features.
• Relevant features [73]: Construct relevance metrics to evaluate the sensitivity of features to the target variable,
and then select key features that are highly correlated with the target variable and exhibit significant class
discrimination capabilities.
• Chi-square test [74]: Evaluate the independence between features and the target variable to determine the most
relevant and sensitive features for the diagnostic model.
2.3.2
Wrapper-based Methods
Wrapper-based methods select optimal feature subsets by relying on the performance of TML models. The core idea of
these methods is to convert the feature selection issue into a feature subset search task, i.e. guiding the selection of the
feature subset based on the model’s performance [65]. The following are common wrapper-based methods.
• Sequential selection [75]: Features are gradually added or remove features via forward selection or backward
elimination to optimize model performance, which is suitable for high-dimensional feature spaces.
• Recursive feature elimination [76]: Iteratively remove features with lower contributions based on the model’s
assessment of feature importance, ultimately retaining the subset of features that most significantly improves
model performance.
• Heuristic search [77]: Utilise heuristic strategies (e.g. genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, ant colony
algorithms, etc.) to perform a global search in the feature space to find the optimal or near-optimal feature
subset. This approach is effective for complex feature combinations and large search spaces.
2.3.3
Embedded-based Methods
Embedded-based methods integrate the feature selection process into the model training, leveraging the model’s own
parameter learning and optimization mechanisms to automatically identify and retain sensitive features for prediction
results [78]. The following are common embedded-based methods.
• Regularization [79]: Introduce L1 or L2 regularization terms during model training to constrain feature
coefficients, achieving automatically selecting and retaining the most influential sensitive features for prediction
results.
6

Running Title for Header
• Tree models [80]: Evaluate information gain, gini impurity reduction or purity improvement during node
splitting to quantify the contribution of each feature to model decisions (e.g. decision tree, random forest,
gradient boosting decision tree, etc.) and identify highly important and sensitive features.
2.3.4
Reduction-based Methods
Reduction-based methods transform the original high dimensional feature space into a low dimensional representation
through mathematical mapping, effectively compressing the number of features and eliminating redundancy while
preserving as much critical information as possible [81]. The following are common reduction-based methods.
• Linear reduction [82]: Utilize linear techniques (e.g. rthogonal transformations or matrix decomposition,
etc.) to project high-dimensional feature space onto low dimensional linear subspaces. This approach can
effectively eliminate features linear correlations while retaining the global structure of the original feature (e.g.
principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, non-negative matrix factorization, etc.).
• Non-linear reduction [83]: Employ non-linear transformation techniques (e.g. manifold learning, kernel
methods, etc.) to embed features into a low dimensional non-linear space. This method can effectively capture
the local neighborhood relationships and manifold structures in the original feature space (e.g. kernel principal
component analysis, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, isometric mapping etc.).
2.4
Intelligent Intensity Recognition
Intelligent intensity recognition establishes a mapping between selected features and cavitation intensity through a
recognition model based on TML. To achieve this goal, the recognition model needs to be trained and learned on labeled
cavitation samples. According to current research progress, we briefly introduce five commonly used TML methods for
CIR in the following sections.
2.4.1
SVM-based Approaches
Support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised learning method based on statistical learning theory, which is widely
used in classification, regression and anomaly detection tasks [6]. Its fundamental idea is to find an optimal hyperplane
in the feature space to maximize the interclass margin, achieving effective separation of samples. Given a training
dataset {X, Y} = (xi, yi) with N samples, xi ∈Rd represents the feature vector of the i-th sample and yi ∈{+1, −1}
denotes its corresponding class label, the basic optimization objective of SVM can be expressed as:
min
w,b
1
2∥w∥2
s.t. yi(wTxi + b) ≥1, i = 1, 2, . . . , N
,
(1)
where w is the normal vector of the hyperplane and b is the bias term. In practical applications, due to noise interference
and overlapping class boundaries, it is difficult for samples to satisfy the strict linear separability assumption. Therefore,
SVM introduces slack variable ξi to construct a soft-margin classifier, as shown in Figure 3. The optimization objective
is adjusted as follows:
min
w,b,ξ
1
2∥w∥2 + C
N
P
i=1
ξi
s.t. yi(wTxi + b) ≥1 −ξi, ξi ≥0
,
(2)
where C is the penalty factor used to control the balance between margin maximization and classification error
minimization. In addition, SVM also introduces kernel methods to implicitly map the original features to a high-
dimensional feature space. The typical kernel functions include radial basis kernel, polynomial kernel and sigmoid
kernel, which are crucial role in accurately modeling complex patterns.
The application of SVM to CIR are systematically summarized in Table 2. According to the research results, the SVM
have exhibited excellent performance in CIR for equipment such as pumps, turbine and pipes. For the above diagnostic
objects, the SVM-based methods need to able to recognize multiple flow cavitation states, not only limited to the binary
classification of cavitation and non-cavitation. Therefore, one-versus-rest (OVR) and one-versus-one (OVO) strategies
have become solutions for SVM [84]. In addition, the researchers improved the diagnostic accuracy of modifying the
SVM and optimizing the SVM parameters. For the former, researchers applied the modified SVM to CIR, such as
least square SVM [85], proximal SVM [58], wavelet SVM [85] and one-class SVM [86], which all achieved better
diagnostic performance than the traditional SVM. For algorithm optimization, researchers focused on simplifying the
complex solution process and optimizing parameter selection of SVM, such as particle swarm optimization-based SVM
[62], cuckoo search algorithm-based SVM [87] and butterfly optimization algorithm-based SVM [57].

2.4.2
DT-based Approaches
Decision tree (DT) is a supervised learning method for classification and regression tasks, which makes decisions at
each internal node by partitioning the feature space into distinct subregions based on feature values [7]. The decision at
each node is made by evaluating a specific feature and splitting the data into subsets according to a threshold value.
Given a training dataset {X, Y} = (xi, yi) with N samples, xi ∈Rd represents the feature vector of the i-th sample
and yi denotes its corresponding class label, the objective of DT is to recursively split the data at each node in order to
create a tree structure that minimizes a measure of impurity, as shown in Figure 4. The basic optimization objective of
DT is as follows:

E(S) = −
CP
c=1
p(c|S)logp(c|S)
,
(3)
where I(yi|S) is a measure of impurity, e.g. Gini impurity G(S) or entropy E(S), S represents the current subset of
the data at given node and p(c|S) is the proportion of class c sample in subset S. To prevent overfitting, the DT are
often pruned by setting a maximum depth or by requiring a minimum number of samples in each leaf node. In addition,
the DT can be enhanced by ensemble methods, such as random forests (RF) [125], gradient boosting machines (GBM)
[126], extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) [127], light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) [128] and extremely
randomized trees (ERT) [129], which combine multiple DTs to improve performance and reduce overfitting.
The application of DT and its derived methods to CIR are comprehensively summarized in Table 3. Based on the
research results, the DT and its its derivatives have also been widely applied in CIR for equipment such as pumps,
turbines, pipelines and valves. For the above diagnostic objects, DT-based methods are able to deal with both binary
classification of cavitation and non-cavitation and multi-class recognition of different cavitation states. In addition,
researchers have proposed a variety of improved DT methods, such as RF [91, 130] and XGBoost [48], which effectively

overcome the shortcomings of traditional DTs by ensemble learning and gradient boosting mechanisms. Furthermore,
Kamali et al. [131] employed a combination of bayesian optimization with DT to automatically select hyperparameters.
Compared to SVM-based approaches, DT-based methods have natural interpretability and can automatically generate
explicit diagnostic rules without relying on additional expert interpretation. In addition, DT-based methods are able to
perform effective diagnosis even in the presence of missing data, which exhibits strong robustness. However, DT-based
methods are often prone to suffer from overfitting, leading to weak generalization and compromising their effectiveness
in complex diagnostic tasks. It is also worth noting that the design of many DT-based models still depends on expert
knowledge, which restricts their universality and flexibility in certain application scenarios.

ANN-based Approaches
Artificial neural network (ANN) is a traditional supervised learning method based on multilayer perceptrons (MLP),
which is commonly applied to classification and regression tasks [8]. Its basic structure consists of an input layer,
several hidden layers and an output layer, which achieves feature mapping through forward propagation and parameter
updating using back propagation, as shown in Figure 5. Given a training dataset {X, Y} = (xi, yi) with N samples,
xi ∈Rd represents the feature vector of the i-th sample and yi ∈Rl denotes its corresponding class label. During the
forward propagation process, the input data xi are sequentially transmitted through each layer. Each layer receives
the output of the previous layer as input, first calculates the weighted sum of that input, then performs a nonlinear
transformation and passes the result to the next layer. The specific process is as follows:
(xh
i )j = σ(
nh−1
X
i=1
wh
j · xh−1
i
+ bh
j ),
(4)
where (xh
i )j is the output of the j-th neuron in the h-th hidden layer, wh
j is the weight between the neurons in the
previous layer, bh
j is the bias of the j-th neuron in the h-th hidden layer, σ represents the activation function (e.g.
Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh, etc.). The predicted output of ANN is:

where (ˆyi)k is the predicted output of the k-th neuron in the output layer, σout represents the activation function
(Sigmoid and Softmax), wout

and bout

are the weights and bias of the output layer, respectively. The optimization
objective of ANN minimizes the error between the predicted output and the groundtruth:

The application of ANN to CIR are systematically reviewed in Table 4. As shown in Table 4, ANN-based methods
have been widely applied to CIR in various hydraulic machinery and fluid systems, such as pumps, turbines, pipes and
propeller. In particular, pump-related research focused on the variety of signal types, which reflects their comprehensive
employment of multi-source information in cavitation monitoring. For pipelines and valves, acoustic, pressure and
vibration measurements are commonly used for effective detection of local cavitation. In general, ANN-based methods
is widely used on different objects and multiple signal sources, which demonstrates the universality and adaptability of
ANN to CIR task.

Compared to SVM and DT-based methods, ANN-based CIR methods can effectively capture potential features in multi-
source monitoring signals to achieve high performance of different equipment cavitation states. However, ANN-based
method still faces two challenges in engineering applications. First, the parameter size and complexity of the model
dramatically increase with the dimension of the input data, which reduces the training efficiency and result in overfitting.
Second, the ANN-based models show a typical black-box nature without theoretical foundation, making its diagnostic
results difficult to support operation and maintenance decisions.

Other Approaches
In addition, other methods are also widely employed in FIR, such as k-nearest neighbours (KNN), expert system (ES).
We will briefly introduce them in this subsection.
KNN-based Approaches. K-nearest neighbours (KNN) is a distance-based supervised learning method, which is
typically used for classification and regression tasks [9]. The core idea is that given a predicted sample, the distance is
firstly calculated between this sample and all labelled samples in the taring set. Then, the k nearest neighbours are
found. Finally, the output of the sample is predicted based on the class or value of these k neighbours, as shown in
Figure 6.

KNN has received much attention in intelligent CIR research, especially in pumps [84, 89, 192], turbines [117] and
valves [150]. Han et al. [84] proposed a KNN-based method for detection cavitation in centrifugal pumps using
vibration and current signals. Paolo et al. [91] attempted a KNN-based model based on vibration signal for a hydraulic
axial piston pump. Sousa et al. [117] developed a method for identifying incipient cavitation in wind turbines by
extracting statical features of vibration signals and applying a KNN-based model. In addition, some researchers
investigated the modified KNN models to enhance cavitation intensity diagnostic effects. Kermani et al. [193] presented
a fuzzy KNN-based method for recognizing the cavitation intensity of dam spillway utilising pressure signals. Zeng et
al . [194] proposed a method integrating dual-tree complex wavelet transform with variational mode decomposition
and Bayesian optimized locally weighted KNN algorithm for intelligent recoignition of multi-state cavitation in vortex
pumps based on current signals.
Although KNN has simplicity and effectiveness, it has several limitations in practical applications. First, the model is
very sensitive to the choice of distance metric and parameter k, and inappropriate settings can significantly affect the
final performance. Second, it has high computational complexity during the inference stage since it needs to calculate
the distance between the test sample and all the training samples, resulting in extremely low efficiency in large-scale
datasets. Third, it is very sensitive to irrelevant or redundant features. Finally, the basic KNN connot automatically
perform feature weighting or learn the importance of features, causing it to depend on feature preprocessing to obtain
the desired performance.
ES-based Approaches. Expert system (ES) is a rule-based artificial intelligence models that emulate the decision
making process of human experts by encoding domain knowledge into a knowledge base and inference engine, which
is widely used in condition monitoring of fluid machinery [10]. The core of ES is to utilise predefined logic rules
extracted from practical experience and expert knowledge to parse the sensor signals and identify different cavitation
states, as shown in Figure 7. Sakthivel et al. [41] proposed a combination of rough set rule extraction and a fuzzy
inference system to achieve cavitation detection and intensity diagnosis in centrifugal pump using vibration signals.
Saeid et al. [195] presented a vibration signal diagnosis method based on the combination of FFT feature extraction and
adaptive fuzzy inference system for intelligent fault diagnosis of centrifugal pumps. Azadeh et al. [196] developed a
fuzzy rule-based inference system approach to realise timely diagnosis of cavitation states in centrifugal pumps.
Although ES has a strong interpretability, it faces several limitations in practical applications. First, the construction of
ES is heavily relies on a priori knowledge of domain experts, resulting in time-consuming and labor-intensive process
of knowledge acquisition. Second, ES cannot update knowledge base or optimize inference rules online, making it
difficult to adapt to new fault patterns. Third, ES typically relys on deterministic logical reference, resulting in weakly

redesigning the rule base, resulting in system inflexibility.

Data Driven Deep Learning
In contrast to TML approaches, data-driven deep learning (DL) methods have gained attention in CIR since their
powerful end-to-end feature learning and representation capabilities. Instead of relying on manually extracted features,
DL models can automatically extract multi-level features directly from original sensor signals, which can reduce the
dependence on expert experience and complex signal preprocessing [197]. A typical DL-based CIR pipeline normally
consists of data collection and end-to-end intensity recognition, as shown in Figure 8, which will be detailed in the
following subsections.
3.1
Data Collection
In modern industrial monitoring systems, data collection is the basis for CIR and other equipment health diagnostics. The
process typically relies on a variety of sensors and control system to continuously acquire signals from the equipment
12

Running Title for Header
under a wide range of operating conditions. The collected data not only presents the classical characteristics of volume,
velocity, variety and veracity, but also exhibits domain-specific attributes determined by industrial environment [198].
• Large volume: Over long-term operation, monitoring systems for equipment continuously record multiple
channel signals. High-frequency measurement (e.g. vibration signals from gearboxes, acoustic emission
signals from cavitation-prone pipelines segments) can significantly increase the data volume.
• Low value density: Although a large amount of sensor data is collected, only a small portion is directly related
to cavitation events or fault states. The vast majority of the records correspond to the normal operating cditions
of the equipments and some of data may be of poor quality due to transmission interruptions, environmental
disturbances or sensor failures.
• Multi-source and heterogeneous formats: Multiple sensors (e.g. vibration, pressure, acoustic, etc.) are often
integrated in industrial monitoring, resulting in heterogeneous data in both structure and sampling rate.
• Data stream characteristics: The development of technologies (e.g. internet of things, high-speed networks,
GPU computing, edge computing, etc.) make it possible to acquire real-time, high-frequency monitoring data
streams, enabling immediate access to machine health information.
Cavitation-related monitoring data are collected from the target system across different operating conditions. The
acquisition devices include acoustic emission sensors, energy sensors, pressure sensors, vibration accelerometers,
ultrasonic sensors and high-speed camera (more detailed see Table 1), which are placed at key locations to capture
the entire "occurrence-development-collapse" process of cavitation. All signals are recorded simultaneously by the
industrial data acquisition unit and stored in original waveforms and lightly preprocessed forms, ensuring the data
covers a wide range of cavitation intensities, which satisfies the training requirements of DL models.
3.2
End-to-end intensity recognition
The DL model directly performs feature learning and cavitation intensity prediction simultaneously from raw monitoring
data, eliminating manual feature extraction and feature selection. In general, its architecture includes an automatic
feature learning module and a prediction module. The DL model training is based on end-to-end error backpropagation,
while optimizing the parameters of both the feature and prediction layers to highly match the learned representation
with the recognized target. According to current research progress, we briefly introduce four typical DL structures for
CIR in the following sections.
3.2.1
DBN-based Approaches
Deep belief network (DBN) is a class of generative graphical models stacked with multiple layers of restricted boltzmann
machine (RBM) [11]. It is able to learn hierarchical abstract features of the input data in an unsupervised learning
manner and achieve classification or regression by supervised fine-tuning, as shown in Figure 9. The RBM is an
undirected bipartite graph consisting of a visible layer v and a hidden layer h, which are fully connected between the
layers and unconnected within the same layer. Its energy function is:

follows:
∆wij = η(< vihj>data−< vihj>recon),
(11)
where, η is the learning rete, < vihj>data and < vihj>recon represent the expected values of the product vihj under
the data distribution and reconstructed distributions, respectively.
DBN has been widely applied in CIR due to its strong capability in learning hierarchical and discriminative features
from raw, high-dimensional and noisy monitoring signals. Wang et al. [199] proposed a fast and effective cavitation
diagnosis approach for hydraulic system vibration signals based on a DBN with sliding window spectrum feature.
Huang et al. [200] presented an automatic weak cavitation recognition method for hydraulic systems based on the
combination of multi-scale entropy feature extraction of fault-sensitive intrinsic mode function and DBN. Liu et al.
[201] developed a method to improve the cavitation diagnosis performance of gear vibration signals by optimizing the
number of hidden layer neurons and learning rate of DBN. Yan et al. [202] devised an improved data preprocessing
method combined with a genetic algorithm optimized DBN to enhance cavitation diagnosis performance for actual gas
turbine.
Although DBN exhibits strong capability in automatic feature learning, it also encounters several limitations in practical
applications. First, the performance of DBN is highly dependent on the setting of hyperparameters, which typically
require repeated tuning for different datasets. Second, DBN training involves layer-wise pretraining and fine-tuning,
leading to relatively high computational cost and long training time.
3.2.2
CNN-based Approaches
Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep feedforward neural network inspired by the receptive field
mechanism of the visual cortex, which is widely applied in computer vision [203, 204, 205, 206], speech recognition
[207, 208, 209], natural language processing [210, 211, 212, 213], time-frequency signal analysis [214, 215, 216, 217]
and so on [218, 219, 220, 221, 222]. Its basic structure typically consists of an input layer, several convolutional layers,
pooling layers, fully connected layers and an output layer. The CNN achieves hierarchical automatic feature extraction
through convolution and pooling operations, as shown in Figure 10, followed by nonlinear transformations via activation
functions and finally performs classification or regression through fully connected layers. Given a training dataset
{X, Y} = (xi, yi) with N samples, xi ∈Rd represents i-th sample and yi ∈{+1, −1} is the corresponding label. For
a one dimensional convolutional network, the operation for the k-th feature map in the h-th layer can be expressed as:
xh
ik = σ(
X
j
xh−1
j
· wh

(12)
where xh
ik represents the output of the k-th feature map in the h-th layer, xh−1
j
is the j-th input feature map from the
(h −1)-th layer, σ(·) is the activation function (e.g. ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, etc.), wh
jk and bh
k are the convolution kernel
and bias corresponding to input channel j and output channel k, respectively. Pooling layers are used to reduce the
spatial or temporal resolution of the feature maps and enhance invariance to translation and noise. For example, the
max pooling can be formulated as:
p(h)
k (u) = max
s∈Ωu(xh
ik)(s),

where Ωu denotes the pooling region centered at position u. After several convolution and pooling layers, the high level

∂w,

(16)
where η is the learning rate, ∂L/∂w and ∂L/∂b are the gradients with respect to w and b, respectively. In general,
CNN can be classified into 1D CNN, 2D CNN and 3D CNN. Based on the above, researchers have developed various
architectures, such as LeNet [12], AlexNet [223], VGGNet [224], DenseNet [14], ResNet [13], MobileNet [15],
ShuffleNet [16].
The application of CNN to CIR are systematically reviewed in Table 5. As shown in Table 5, CNN-based methods have
been widely applied to CIR in various hydraulic machinery and fluid systems, such as pumps, turbines, pipes, valve
and propellers. Among these, pumps are the most extensively studied, with both 1D CNN and 2D CNN architectures
being applied. Specifically, 1D CNN is mainly used for processing time series signals (e.g. acoustic, vibration, prsssure,
current, etc.), while 2D CNN often relies on time-frequency representations or high-speed images to capture spatial
features of cavitation. Research on turbines, pipes, propellers and valves is relatively limited, which indicates potential
for further expansion. Many CNN-based studies directly employ established network architectures, which makes it
challenging to fully tailor the models to the unique characteristics of CIR. In general, CNN-based CIR studies show
a trend toward integrating multiple signal types and network structures, though the maturity varies across different
objects.
Compared with DBNs, CNNs offer advantages in CIR, including automatic extraction of local features, reduced reliance
on manual feature design and higher computational efficiency. In addition, CNNs also demonstrate higher performance
and robustness when processing images and time-frequency two-dimensional features. However, CNNs have limited
capability in capturing strong nonlinear and long-term dependency features and their performance is sensitive to the
quantity and quality of training data.

RNN-based Approaches
Recurrent neural network (RNN) is class of neural network models designed to capture temporal dependencies and
sequential correlations in data [17]. Unlike CNNs, RNN introduce recurrent connections in hidden layer, allowing
information from previous time steps to influence the current output, as shown in Figure 11. The basic operation of a
vanilla RNN for a sequence {x1, x2, · · · , xT } can be expressed as:
ht = σ(Wxhxt + Whhht−1 + bh),
(17)
yt = σout(Whyht + by),
(18)
where ht is the hidden state at time t, Wxh, Whh, Why are the input-to-hidden, hidden-to-hidden and hidden-to-output
weight matrices, respectively. bh and by are biases, σ(·) is typically a nonlinear activation function and σout(·) is the
output activation function. The objective function is to minimize the sequence prediction loss over all time steps:
min

t ),
(19)
where θ = {Wxh, Whh, Why, bh, by} and are updated through backpropagation through time. To address the vanishing
and exploding gradient issues in vanilla RNN, researchers have developed various architectures, such as LSTM [18],
BiLSTM [309] and GRU [19].
RNN

RNN-based approaches have been effectively applied to CIR. For instance, some research [150, 174, 310] directly
applied LSTM to CIR of valves and pumps, respectively. Lee et al. [261] and Zhu et al. [311] proposed combining
16

Running Title for Header
CNN and RNN methods to achieve CIR in pumps using high-speed images and vibration time-frequency images,
respectively. Zhang et al. [312] developed a multi-dimensional feature fusion method based on a convolutional gated
recurrent unit to achieve CIR in centrifugal pumps. Liu et al. [313] designed a GRU-based method using vibration data
to a realize CIR of firefighting pumps. Zhao et al. [314] presented a VMD-dung bettle optimization-GRU-attention
model using pressure data to achieve CIR in pumps and turbines.
Compared to DBNs and CNNs, RNN-based models have superior capabilities in modeling temporal dependencies and
capturing highly time-correlated signal patterns. However, their training process is often time-consuming and they are
more susceptible to gradient vanishing and exploding issues. Moreover, their performance can degrade when data are
insufficient or noisy.
3.2.4
Transformer-based Approaches
Transformer is a deep learning architecture entirely based on the attention mechanism, which has become the in-
frastructure for large language models [20, 315]. Unlike CNNs and RNNS, the Transformer discards recurrent and
convolutional structures, instead of employing a fully parallelizable multi-head self-attention mechanism to model
global dependencies, significantly improving training speed and long sequence modeling capability [316, 317]. A
standard Transformer consists of an encoder and a decoder stack. The encoder comprises multi-head self-attention
layers, positional encoding, feed forward network, residual connections and layer normalization, see Figure 12. The
decoder adds masked self-attention and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms to the encoder. Given an input sequence
X = [x1, x2, · · · , xN], linear projections are applied to obtain the Query, Key and Value matrices:
Q = XWQ,
K = XWK,
V = XWV ,
(20)
where WQ, WK, WV are learnable weight matrices. The self-attention computation is defined as:
Attention(Q, K, V ) = softmax
QK⊤
√dk

V,
(21)
where dk is the dimension of the key vectors. The multi-head self-attention mechanism computes h parallel attention
heads and concatenates results:
MultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(h1, . . . , hh)WO,
(22)
hi = Attention(QW i
Q, KW i
K, V W i
V ),
(23)
where WO is the output projection matrix. Based on the above theories, researchers present a variety of improved
architectures for different tasks, such as ViT [318], SwinT [319], BERT [320], Linformer [321] and CLIP [322].
Transformer as an emerging deep learning architecture that has also has been introduced into the field of CIR. For
example, He et al. [285] proposed a model that combines Short-time Fourier Transform, generative adversarial network
and Swin-Transformer to achieve CIR using vibration signal spectrograms. Jiang et al. [323] presented a combination
of continuous wavelet transform and Swin Transformer method for CIR in centrifugal pumps. Shang et al. [324]
developed a lightweight vision transformer model combining adaptive convolution and mobile vision transformer blocks
to achieve early-stage CIR under complex and noisy conditions. Zhang et al. [325] designed a deep learning approach
using mel-spectrogram representations combined with self-attention mechanisms to realise CIR from hydrofoil acoustic
signals. Yu et al. [295] proposed a hierarchical knowledge-guided acoustic CIR method based on graph convolutional
networks and reweighted hierarchical knowledge correlation matrices using various Transformer architectures.
Compared to CNNs, the application of Transformer is constrained by multiple factors, including the requirement
for large-scale and high-quality labeled datasets, higher computational cost due to complex self-attention operations
and the challenge of effectively modeling domain-specific features when applied to relatively small or noisy datasets.
Transformer offers strong capabilities in capturing long-term dependencies and global contextual information, making
it well suited for tasks with strong spatial and temporal correlations of signals. In addition, it has high flexibility in
addressing multi-modal data. However, Transformer typically requires more computational resources and careful
parameter tuning, which can make it less efficient for on-site or real-time monitoring scenarios. Furthermore, it is prone
to overfitting and may struggle to generalize well compared to more lightweight structures in the case of insufficient
training data.

Data-Knowledge Driven Deep Learning

process, DKDL not only can enhance model interpretability, but also ensure the predictions comply with fundamental
physical principle. This hybrid paradigm effectively bridges the gap between data-driven inference and physics-based
modeling. A typical DKDL pipeline for CIR generally includes data and knowledge collection, deep feature learning
and physical knowledge learning, as shown in Figure 13, which will be detailed in the following subsections.

For DKDL framework, the data component utilises various signals acquired from different sensors described previously,
which characterize the operating states of hydraulic machinery under various work conditions. On this basis, the model
incorporates multiple types of physical knowledge from the hydraulic machinery domain, which are structured and
formalized to support feature learning and recognition tasks [326]. These knowledge types include:
• Physical equations knowledge [327]: Includes fluid mechanics governing equations (e.g. Navier-Stokes
equations), bubble dynamics equations (e.g. Rayleigh-Plesset equation) and cavitation inception criteria (e.g.
cavitation coefficient), which describe the fundamental principle of liquid flow and cavitation formation.
• Domain expert knowledge [328]: Derived from the long-term practical experience and diagnostic heuristics
of engineers (e.g. abnormal vibration patterns, acoustic characteristics, pressure variation rules, historical
cases, fault mechanism analysis, determination rules, etc.), provides diagnostic basis and domain background
information.
• Physical parameters knowledge [329]: Key physical quantities obtained during the operation or experimental
monitoring of hydraulic machinery (e.g. flow rate, rotational speed, pressure values, temperature, etc.). These
parameters reflect the operational state and cavitation occurrence conditions of the equipment, providing highly
relevant physical information for models.
• Physical structure knowledge [31]: Covers the hierarchical and dependency relationships among target classes,
the mutual exclusion or inclusion constraints between classes, the coupling and constraint relationships
among physical variables and the structural layout and functional dependencies among hydraulic machinery
components. This type of knowledge enables the model to incorporate multi-level correlation information
during the learning process.

methods, which consists of data acquisition, knowledge collection, deep feature learning and physical knowledge
learning.
These knowledge can be used to construct physical constraints, enhance feature representations or directly construct
physical knowledge networks, which effectively guides the model to learn discriminative patterns matching practical
operating conditions and physical principle. The DKDL framework not only retains the automatic feature learning
advantages of data-driven methods, but also significantly improves the physical consistency and generalization capability
of recognition results.
4.2
Deep Feature Learning
Deep feature learning aims to utilize deep neural networks to automatically extract high-level feature representations
from raw multi-source sensor data, supporting subsequent fusion with physical knowledge. The input data typically
includes acoustic signals, vibration signals, pressure pulsation signals, current signals and cavitation flow field images
captured by high-speed imaging, which are preprocessed and directly fed into the deep learning model to perform
end-to-end feature extraction. The deep learning architectures employed are consistent with data-driven deep learning
approaches.
4.3
Physical Knowledge Learning
Physical knowledge learning aims to seamlessly integrate fundamental physical principle, domain experience, key
physical parameters and structural relationships information into both the training and inference processes of deep
models, which can enhance the physical consistency, cross-condition generalization capability and interpretability of
CIR results. In view of current research progress, three representative physical knowledge learning approaches are
briefly introduced in the following sections.
4.3.1
Physical Knowledge Network
The physical knowledge network (PKN) is an essential component of the DKDL framework. Its core principle involves
explicitly incorporating the physical principle and characteristics of hydraulic machinery through customized network
architectures, enhancing the physical consistency and interpretability of CIR. Unlike generic data-driven deep learning
architectures, the PKNs incorporate specific physical mechanisms into their hierarchical design, connection patterns
and kernel construction, enabling a better capture of intrinsic relationships among multidimensional physical variables,
equipment structures and signal features, as shown in Figure 14. In current research, typical PKN architectures include:
• Hierarchical neural networks [291, 330]: Design network architectures based on hierarchical relationships
among cavitation intensity labels or physical variables, enhancing the ability to discriminate multi-level
cavitation states.
19

Running Title for Header
• GCN-based hybrid networks [295, 331]: Leverage graph convolutional netwotk (GCN) to model the correlation
relationships between physical variables or cavitation intensity labels and integrate them with other feature
learning networks (e.g. CNNs, RNNs, Transformer, etc.), enabling effective guidance and constraint of deep
features.
• Transformation-domain neural works [332, 333]: Directly replace or modify certain components of traditional
data-driven neural networks (e.g. activation functions, kernel function, inter-layer weights, etc.) with signal
transformation methods (e.g. wavelet transform, Fourier transform, etc.), enabling the model to acquire
time-frequency domain or frequency domain feature extraction capabilities at the structural level.

Compared to data-driven deep learning approaches for CIR, the application of PKNs in this field remains in its infancy
and the current research is relatively limited. For hierarchical neural networks, Gou et al. [291] proposed a two-stage
sub-master transition hierarchical network for CIR using acoustic signals from valve and pipeline systems. Wen et al.
[334] presented a hierarchical convolutional neural network method to achieve bearing fault diagnosis using vibration
signals. Guo et al. [335] developed a hierarchical learning rate adaptive deep convolutional neural network to implement
bearing fault diagnosis using vibration signals. For GCN-based hybrid networks, Sha et al. [295] proposed a hierarchical
knowledge-guided acoustic CIR method based on graph convolutional networks and reweighted hierarchical knowledge
correlation matrices. Li et al. [331] presented a graph isomorphic network with a spatio-temporal attention mechanism
to achieve fault diagnosis of hydraulic axial piston pumps using weighted graph data constructed from univariate
signals. Hua et al. [336] designed a graph convolutional transformer network method to perform fault diagnosis of
slurry circulating equipment using frequency-domain graph data constructed from high-frequency vibration signals.
For transformation-domain networks, Gao [337] presented a neural-wavelet network to achieve process diagnostics
based on magnetic flowmeter data and power load demand prediction using electrical load signals. Won et al. [338]
proposed a method combining wavelet coefficient variance features with neural networks to realise cavitation detection
in pumps using pressure signals. Wang et al. [339] suggested a method combining wavelet transform, rough sets and a
partially linearized neural network to achieve centrifugal pump system fault diagnosis. Rani et al. [340] introduced a
probabilistic Fourier neural operator method to conduct process fault detection using multivariate historical process
data. Tan [341] proposed a Fourier neural network and generalized single hidden layer network method to perform
multi-fault diagnosis. Yu et al. [342] developed a fast Fourier convolutional gated current unit method to perform fault
prediction using remaining useful life data.
Compared to data-driven deep learning approaches, the PHN exhibits higher physical consistency and interpretability in
CIR and demonstrate better generalization under small-sample or noisy conditions. However, the design of PKNs relies
heavily on domain expert knowledge and involves complex construction. In addition, the training process requires
simultaneous optimization of data features and knowledge constraints, resulting in relatively high computational costs.
4.3.2
Physical Knowledge Embedded
The core concept of physical knowledge embedded (PKE) is to explicitly integrate domain-specific knowledge into
data-driven deep learning models, enabling feature extraction and physical constraints to operate simultaneously. Unlike
20

Running Title for Header
purely data-driven feature learning, this approach injects physical information directly into the structural design or
feature stream of the model, which balances data representation capability with physical consistency and enhances
generalization and interpretability in CIR [343], as shown in Figure 15. Given a dataset {X, K} = {(xi, ki)}N
i=1 with
xi represents i-th sample and ki represents the corresponding physical knowledge, the embedding process can be
expressed as:
Fembed = Φ(fdata(X), fknow(K)),
(24)
where fdata(·) is the operator for data-driven feature extraction, fknow(·) is the mapping operator for physical knowledge
and Φ(·, ·) denotes the fusion strategy. The common forms of physical knowledge embedding include:
• Feature-level fusion [344]: At the model input layer, raw sensor data and physical parameters are concatenated
or fused, and uniformly encoded into the network so that both data features and physical information are
provided from the outset.
• Intermediate embedding [345]: Domain specific prior knowledge calculated from physical principle are
introduced into intermediate layers as additional channels, allowing alongside data-driven features toward
subsequent layers.
• Knowledge-guided attention [346]: Physical knowledge is generated as attention weights or masked areas
to guide the model to focus on physically significant regions or variables during feature learning, enhancing
discriminative and physical interpretability of features.

In contrast to data-driven deep learning approaches for CIR, the use of PKEs in this domain is still at an early
developmental stage and the current research is relatively limited. For example, Sha et al. [295] developed target
classes hierarchical knowledge embedding representation learning based on convolutional neural network and word
embedding technique for CIR. Miglianti [347] proposed a method combining semi-empirical approaches and hybrid
machine learning models to perform propeller cavitation noise prediction. Chen et al. [304] presented a hierarchical
transformer method to achieve ship fault recognition using acoustic noise signals. Qiao et al. [348] designed a prior
knowledge embedding contrastive attention learning network method to conduct rolling bearing fault diagnosis using
vibration signals. Du et al. [349] suggested a knowledge-embedded deep belief network to achieve fault diagnosis of
building chillers.
Compared to PHNs, PKEs directly embeds domain physical knowledge into the input layer or intermediate feature
layers, offering flexible modification and low implementation cost, which allows for rapid application to existing deep
neural networks. However, the physical knowledge embedded by PKE primarily consists of local parameters or prior
features, making it difficult to construct complex global physical relationships. When the knowledge is incomplete
or biased, it is susceptible to noise and variations in distribution. Therefore, PKE is more suitable for providing
lightweight physical information enhancement to existing models, whereas PHN is better suited for tasks requiring
in-depth characterization of multi-level physical mechanisms.
4.3.3
Physical Knowledge Constraint Loss
Physical knowledge constraint loss (PKCL) aims to explicitly incorporate physical principle, empirical rules or
operational boundaries into the optimization objective of data-driven deep learning models [350], as shown in Figure
16. The PKCL can guide the neural network to produce outputs consistent with know physical mechanisms and domain
constraints by penalizing predictions violating physical feasibility, improving the reliability and interpretability of the
deep learning model [21]. Given a dataset {X, Y, K} = {(xi, yi, ki)}N
i=1, where xi denotes the i-th input sample, yi is
the ground truth label and ki represents the corresponding physical knowledge. The total loss function can be expressed
as:
Ltotal = Ldata(fθ(X), Y) + λLphy(fθ(X), K),
(25)
21

Running Title for Header
where Ldata is the primary task data loss, Lphy is the physical knowledge constraint loss to measure the degree of
violation of physical principle or constraints, λ is a weighting factor controlling the balance between task performance
and physical consistency, fθ(·) denotes the deep model represented by the parameter θ. The common forms of PKCL
include:
• Boundary condition penalty: Restrict the output prediction values within predefined physical ranges.
• Physical principle penalty: Measure the deviation between predicted values and calculated values derived from
physical equations or empirical models.
• Trend consistency penalty: Enforce the output of prediction results to remain consistent with the inherent
properties of physical processes.

The PKCL has attracted significant attention and been widely applied in solving ordinary differential equations and
other physical-related modeling tasks, but its research in CIR is still in the early developmental stage. For instance,
Wang et al. [351] proposed a physical informed neural network method to achieve fault severity identification in axial
piston pumps using pressure signals. Keshun et al. [352] presented a dynamic physical with a data-driven quadratic
neural network and bidirectional LSTM to conduct rolling bearing damage assessment using vibration signals. Keshun
et al. [353] developed a sound-vibration physical-information fusion constraint-guided deep learning method to perform
bearing fault diagnosis using acoustic and vibration signals. Pan et al. [354] designed a physics-guided neural network
to deliver condenser fault diagnosis using key physical indicator signals. Li et al. [355] proposed a physical-guided
multi-teacher knowledge distillation network method to achieve external gear pump fault diagnosis using multimodal
signals.
Compared with PKE, the PKCL introduces physical constraints into the loss function, synchronizing the data-driven
learning process with physical consistency optimization. Its advantages lie in the ability to continuously impose the
supervision from physical principle on the model outputs during the training phase, which enhances the interpretability
and physical credibility without modifying the network structure. However, PKCL is sensitive to the design of constraint
terms and weight selection, which may lead to difficulties in model optimization when the physical knowledge is
incomplete or noisy.

Discussions
With the continuous development of cavitation intensity recognition (CIR) technology, research has evolved from
traditional machine learning reliant on manually extracted features to deep learning with end-to-end feature extraction,
which develops physics-guided diagnostic models incorporating physical knowledge. At the end of this review, we
attempt to describe a roadmap and discuss challenges of CIR based on a systematic analysis of relevant literature from
2004 to 2025, as shown in Figure 17, aiming to inspire readers to understand potential research trends and directions in
this field over the next five to ten years.
5.1
High-Quality Multi-Source Data
High-quality multi-source data is the foundation for reliable cavitation intensity recognition (CIR) and related industrial
equipment fault diagnosis. Current datasets generally suffer from insufficient sample size, imbalanced fault categories,
disproportionate distribution between normal and fault conditions and incomplete operational condition coverage. These
issues not only hinder comprehensive feature learning during the training phase, but also reduce diagnostic performance
and stability in practical applications. In addition, multi-source data (e.g. acoustic signals, vibration signals, pressure

pulsations, current signals, high-speed imaging, etc.) are seldom acquired synchronously, which can lead to temporal
misalignment and feature distortion during multimodal fusion.
In the future, the focus should be on establishing standardized multi-modal data collection protocols to ensure
comparability and interoperability of data collected from different experimental platforms. At the same time, low-cost
and high-accuracy sensing technologies should be explored to enhance the feasibility of data acquisition and large-
scale cavitation status database should be established using real-time monitoring and remote acquisition technologies.
Meanwhile, the integration of data augmentation techniques (e.g. signal simulation, noise modeling, signal mixing,
etc.), domain adaptation and transfer learning can be employed to migrate knowledge from similar operating conditions
or related equipment to expand the training sample space. In addition, hybrid modeling frameworks integrating
simulated and experimental data can also effectively alleviate sample insufficiency and enhance the model robustness
and cross-scenario adaptability.
5.2
Physics Informed Diagnostic Model
Physics informed diagnostic models can enhance the physical consistency and interpretability of fault diagnostic results
by fusing data-driven learning with domain physical knowledge, which can strengthen the credibility of decision
credibility and engineering applicability. Although physical information neural networks (PINNs), physical knowledge
embedding (PKE) and physical knowledge constraint loss (PKCL) have achieved success in science and engineering
fields (e.g. fluid mechanics, structural health monitoring, energy systems, etc.), they are still in infancy in cavitation
intensity recognition. In addition, the existing studies mainly focus on embedding individual physical laws or simplified
models and lacks a unified deep integration framework. In practice, this class of methods mainly face challenges
including the difficulty of translating multi-scale coupled dynamic equations of the cavitation process into directly
usable constraints, the the incompleteness or noise in physical knowledge of industrial systems and the difficulty of
balancing physical constraints with the flexibility of data-driven models.
Future research should explore automated and adaptive knowledge integration by leveraging machine-readable physical
formula libraries, symbolic learning and graph-based knowledge representations to enable the automatic extraction and
dynamic embedding of physical knowledge. In addition, physics-oriented interpretable tools should be developed to
allow engineers to intuitively understand the model’s decision process.
5.3
Lightweight Diagnostic Model
In industrial embedded monitoring systems, computational efficiency and hardware resource limitations create an urgent
demand for lightweight diagnostic models, while requiring the model complexity be reduced without significantly
compromising performance. However, many current deep learning models contain millions or even hundreds of millions
of parameters, which not only increases storage and computational burdens but also makes real-time deployment difficult
and limits adaptability to low-power edge devices. Furthermore, in multi-source data scenarios, models usually need to
simultaneously process multimodal signals, resulting in traditional large-scale models are more prone to overfitting or
response delays for on-line applications.
Future research should focus on designing task-specific compact network architectures for multi-source inputs, incorpo-
rating multimodal feature fusion and knowledge guidance into the architecture. In terms of compression techniques,
model pruning, parameter quantization, low-rank decomposition and knowledge distillation can be explored. In
particular, multi-teacher distillation strategies for handing missing modalities, which can retain critical feature extraction
capabilities while reducing computational costs. In addition, hardware optimization algorithms should be integrated,
such as operator acceleration for embedded chips and FPGA or ASIC deployment schemes. At the same time, explo-
ration of neuromorphic computing and event-driven neural networks is also warranted to further lower latency and
power consumption. Furthermore, lightweight models must also incorporate stability design in noisy environments,
ensuring they maintain high reliability and performance in real-world industrial conditions.
5.4
Interpretability of Diagnostic Model
In safety-critical domains (e.g. aerospace, marine, energy, etc.), interpretability is a core factor in establishing
trust in intelligent diagnostic systems. However, current deep learning models lack explicit reasoning about fault
mechanisms and physical correlation analysis, making it difficult for maintenance personnel to fully trust the diagnostic
conclusions of models. Existing studies aimed at improving interpretability primarily include visualizing attention
weight distributions to reveal regions of interest for the model, conducting sensitivity analysis on multimodal inputs
to evaluate feature contributions and embedding physical knowledge to link decision processes with fault evolution
mechanisms. Nevertheless, there are still significant technical challenges in enhancing interpretability while maintaining
diagnostic performance under complex multi-source data and non-linear feature scenarios.
24

Running Title for Header
Future research should focus on constructing diagnostic model architectures with interpretability as a core design
principle, taking interpretability requirements into account during the network structure design stage. Causality-driven
feature learning methods should be introduced to model the relationships between input features and fault causal
chains, enhancing the scientific rigor and credibility of inferences. In addition, visualization and explanation tools
based on domain expert decision logic should be developed, enabling model outputs to be presented in an intuitive
manner. Moreover, research into explainability should incorporate cross-modal information fusion strategies, enabling
complementary insights from different types of sensor data. This approach enhances trustworthiness and transparency
while preserving the model’s high performance and robustness in real-world industrial applications.
5.5
Industrial Agents
Industrial agents as an autonomous fault monitoring and decision control unit, which exhibit significant potential for
intelligent cavitation intensity recognition in complex manufacturing systems. These agents integrated with industrial
internet of things platforms, which can manage real-time multi-source data streams, perform distributed diagnostics and
coordinate maintenance task. With the maturation of large model technology, its vertical applications have endowed
industrial agents with enhanced knowledge comprehension and cross-task reasoning capabilities, enabling more
precise feature extraction, complex pattern recognition and natural human-machine interaction in CIR. The industrial
agent ensures interoperability across heterogeneous systems, safeguarding data exchange security and privacy during
industrial data exchange. Furthermore, the transferable agent architecture adapts to diverse operational conditions.
Future research should explore integrating large model prompt engineering with reinforcement learning, adaptive
diagnostic strategies and cloud-edge-end collaborative frameworks, which can significantly enhance fault diagnosis
performance interpretability and real-time performance in industrial operations.

Conclusions
In this paper, we systematically review of the development of cavitation intensity recognition (CIR), focusing on the
evolution from traditional machine learning methods to physical-informed deep learning frameworks. In general, the
development of CIR can be divided into three stages. In the past, CIR was implemented through step of data collection,
manual feature extraction and intensity recognition. In this stage, traditional machine learning models were able to
accomplish the recognition tasks, which are heavily depended on expert domain knowledge. With the rapid progression
deep learning in recent years, end-to-end deep learning models have been extensively applied to automatically learn
features from multi-modal cavitation data, significantly enhancing recognition performance and robustness. However,
data-driven learning models cannot guarantee physical consistency, rendering them unsuitable for practical engineering
applications. To address this limitation, physical-informed diagnostic models integrate domain knowledge into the
deep learning process, enhancing the model interpretability and generalization capabilities under complex operating
conditions. Finally, we discuss the challenges of CIR including multi-source data standardization, model lightweighting,
interpretability and engineering deployment. In addition, we outline a roadmap for future studies. This review aims to
systematically summarize the development of CIR technologies, providing valuable references for intelligent cavitation
diagnosis in industrial applications.
