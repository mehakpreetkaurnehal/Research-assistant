Abstract 
Given the increasing need for large aperture antennas in space missions, the difficulty of 
fitting such structures into small launch vehicles has prompted the design of de- ployable 
antenna systems. The thesis introduces a new Triple Scissors Deployable Truss Mechanism 
(TSDTM) for space antenna missions. The new mechanism is to be stowed during launch and 
efficiently deploy in orbit, offering maximum aperture size while taking up minimal launch 
volume. The thesis covers the entire design pro- cess from geometric modeling, kinematic 
analysis with screw theory and Newtonian approaches, dynamic analysis by eigenvalue and 
simulation methods, and verification with SolidWorks. In addition, optimization routines 
were coded based on Support Vector Machines for material choice in LEO environments and 
Neural Networks for geometric setup. The TSDTM presented has enhanced structural 
dynamics with good comparison between simulation and analytical predictions. The structure 
op- timized proved highly accurate, with a deviation of just 1.94% between machine 
learning-predicted and simulated natural frequencies, demonstrating the potential of 
incorporating AI-based methods in space structural design.

Introduction  
Deployable mechanism is a type of mechanism which can be changed from a folded compact 
form to an expectant deployed state, and can be a full stable structure with capacity of load 
adaptation [1, 2]. Because of the excellent performance in space applications, deployable 

mechanisms are extensively applied to construct large space structures, e.g., deployable mast, 
deployable antenna, etc., and are of great importance in space missions like earth observation, 
telecommunications, scientific researches etc. Due to the high storability and light weight, the 
deployable antenna with flexible cable net is one of the most de-sired antennas in aerospace 
applications [3, 4]. Numerous efforts, such as innovative design concepts, analysis methods 
and experiments, were devoted to improve the deployable antennas technology. Large 
deployable antennas have been built for space missions with different structural schemes, 
however, most of them can be classified as radial structures (e.g. Lockheed’s Wrap- Rib 
antenna, Harris’ Rigid-Rib and ESA’s MBB antenna Hinged- Rib), modular structures (e.g. 
JAXA’s ETSVIII, Tashkent’s KRT10, OKB-MEI’s TKSA-6) and peripheral truss (e.g. 
Northrop-Grumman’s AstroMesh, Harris’ hoop-truss and hoop-column, GTU’s MIR 
reflector experiment, ESA’s LDA) [5, 6]. 
Of these, peripheral ring antennas having the benefit of self-synchronization, high thermo-
elastic stability, and deployment dependability have been studied for the last few years. Since 
the early 1980s Soviet space programs originated at GTU, and studies in some pantograph 
ring concepts and related technologies have been conducted [7, 8]. In 1999 a 5.5-m peripheral 
pantograph structure with radial tensed membrane ribs was flown and deployed on the MIR 
station. Pantographs and derived linkages have been studied in great detail at GTU, TUM, 
and other research groups [9]. Conversely, double ring structure, like Cambridge's 
Deployable Mesh Reflector, is made up of two concentric and peripheral pantograph rings of 
unequal heights connected radially by a third set of pairs of pantographs, despite the seeming 
complication, the whole mechanism has single mobility and high stiffness and accuracy [10]. 
Chinese scholars have put forward two categories of double-ring deployable truss ideas based 
on parallelogram mechanism, structural rigidity is confirmed through prototype testings [11]. 
Astro Aerospace Company has designed one type of AstroMesh deployable antenna 
composed of two symmetrical parabolic cable nets, one metal mesh reflector surface, and one 
deployable ring mechanism, they own more than 15 years of uninterrupted developing history 
[12, 13]. JAXA also created two truss antennas of 19-meter diameter, which apply to the 
satellite communication service with engineering test satellite ETS-VIII launched in 
December 2006. The antenna was sustained by 14 hexagonal truss modules of diameter 4.9 
meters, and each module consists of a mesh surface, cable network, and deployable structures 
made up of six basic deployable units [14]. A research group headed by L. Datashvili 
proposed the double pantograph-based peripheral ring [15], which meets the requirement of 
much less mass and smaller folded volume with stability and deployment reliability. Besides 

the above-discussed design issues, our research team in HIT has also made great 
contributions in the field of large deployable mechanisms, such as the synthesis of deployable 
mechanisms [16], mobility analysis [17], optimization design [18], and cable net form-
finding [19]. This paper presents our recent effort in a new concept design for a large mesh 
deployable antenna. 
In response to the growing requirement for satellite communications services and Earth 
observation missions, we design a ring-based structure made of multi-deployable modules. In 
the present work, a new Triple Scissor Deployable Truss Mechanism (TSDTM) is presented 
as a viable option for deployable structures in space missions. The TSDTM is made up of 
modularly linked scissor-shaped units in a truss configuration that can be folded and 
deployed efficiently with high structural integrity. Compared to traditional deployable 
trusses, the mechanism has better compactness in the deployed or stowed condition and 
stiffness in the fully deployed condition, due to which it is highly suitable for large antennas. 
The benefits of the TSDTM are its high deployment ratio, structural efficiency, and 
versatility in a wide range of space-borne applications. Utilizing the kinematic characteristics 
of the scissor mechanism, the designed structure possesses geometric stability in deployment 
with the lowest mechanical complexity. Moreover, the modularity of the design enables 
scalable realization, qualifying it for applications that entail the use of large-aperture antennas 
in satellite communications and remote sensing. 
This work is based on previous achievements in deployable mechanism synthesis and 
optimization. It aims to advance the development of highly efficient and dependable space 
structures. Future research will focus on refining structural optimization, incorporating 
actuation mechanisms, and experimental validations for real-world performance under 
simulated space conditions. An exhaustive study was performed to verify the Triple Scissor 
Deployable Truss Mechanism (TSDTM). The mechanism was initially designed in 
SolidWorks, followed by analytical kinematic analysis to compare its motion properties. To 
authenticate these results, a multi-body simulation using MSC ADAMS was done with the 
guarantee of correct kinematic behavior. Then, dynamic analysis with the Lagrangian method 
is performed to find the natural frequencies and structural stability. To further confirm these 
results, finite element simulations in ANSYS were performed, which verified the analytical 
predictions. This combined approach guarantees the reliability and efficiency of TSDTM for 
space missions, especially in large-aperture deployable antennas. 
It is crucial to estimate the natural frequency of the TSDTM in order to keep its stability and 
dynamic performance during deployment and operation in space. The natural frequencies 

were determined using analytical derivations and finite element analysis was performed to 
validate the results. The results showed that the structure remains free from resonant 
vibrations. A well-optimized range for natural frequency is needed to eliminate structural 
resonance. The findings verified that TSDTM has a high natural frequency 0.1182, which is 
beneficial for the structural design for space. Further refinement and development will be 
targeted to the structural damping characteristics to make it more rigid during real work 
conditions. 
Problem Statement 
Despite their critical role in satellite communications and Earth observation, large-aperture 
space antennas face significant challenges related to compactness, deployment efficiency, 
and structural stability. Conventional deployable mechanisms, such as single-ring and 
double-ring trusses, often exhibit limitations in mechanical reliability and storage efficiency. 
This research introduces the Triple Scissor Deployable Truss Mechanism (TSDTM), a 
modular structure designed to enhance compactness in the stowed configuration and 
structural rigidity in the fully deployed state. The study employs kinematic analysis, dynamic 
simulations using MSC ADAMS and ANSYS, and finite element analysis to evaluate 
TSDTM’s performance. The findings demonstrate its superiority over conventional 
mechanisms in terms of deployment time, natural frequency, and storage efficiency. 
 
Proposed Design for Single Deployable Unit: 
The basic building block of the modular mechanism was initially designed to be a single 
scissors link. The basic modular units in the antenna are interconnected to form a circular 
deployable mechanism, which is developed in a methodical manner to ensure a clear 
progression from a simple configuration to the final design. Fig. 1 shows the step-by-step 
development of modules from basic scissors links and their integration into the finalized 
basic deployable unit. 

 
Fig. 1 Step-by-step development of modules from basic scissors links 
 
Then two more scissor links were symmetrically added on either side of the first link to 
increase the overall span and create the core structure, to improve structural support and 
stability, supporting links were added between the scissor units. These links were essential 
for keeping the expanding structure aligned and rigid. Finally, four horizontal links were 
incorporated to complete the single unit. 
The triple scissors links assembly's top and bottom horizontal links fixed the modular unit's 
stretched length and guaranteed even load distribution. This methodical process made it 
possible for an orderly assembly, guaranteeing that every phase added to the antenna’s 
overall stability and performance. The top and bottom links are retrained at an angle of 50°, 
whereas the fully deployed modular unit is constrained at an angle of 80° between the 
scissors links. The high storage ratio that this innovative unit with triple scissors links 
mechanism is designed to provide makes it ideal for large-aperture space antennas with 
strong structural integrity. Ample surface area for efficient signal capture and transmission is 
provided by the 25m aperture. The TSDTM's detailed stowed structure is shown in Fig. 2. 
The angle between the scissors and the top and bottom links is 12.54° when the device is 
fully stowed. 

 
Fig. 2 Detailed stowed structure 
 
Geometric Design of Single Deployable Unit: 
Fig. 6 shows that the basic deployable unit contains four horizontal links and ten diagonal 
links. This modular assembly was configured for an antenna of 25m aperture. A detailed 
comparative analysis of deformation patterns and storage ratios is performed for a 25m 
aperture antenna formed from 12, 18 and 24 deployable modular units. 
Due to its exceptional structural integrity and performance, the space antenna truss assembly 
consisting of 12 deployable modular units, has been chosen for more study. As a result, 6.47 
meters is the estimated stretched length of the base module for a 12-unit antenna assembly. 
The angle between the two-diagonal scissors links, designated 𝐿1 and 𝐿2, was limited to 80° 
for the fully deployed structure in order to attain the optimal deployment. For the triple 
scissors link modular unit, the exact dimensions of each link were methodically calculated 
using geometry and trigonometric connections. 
 
tan(40°) =
𝐿3
2.545 = 2.14𝑚 
(1) 
As the unit is symmetrical; the lengths L3, L4, L5, and L6 are equal. To calculate the lengths of 
diagonal links L1 and L2, we consider a right triangle and set the link L1 as hypotenuse. The 
angle between links L1 and L3 is 50°. The mathematical formulation given in equation (2) is 
applied to calculate the length of links L1 and L2. 
 
sin( 50°) = 5.09
𝐿1
=   6.645𝑚= 𝐿2 
(2) 
The length of diagonal links L7, L8, L9 and L10 were half of length for link L1, equation (3). 

 
𝐿7 = 𝐿8 = 𝐿9 = 𝐿10 = 3.323𝑚 
(3) 
Similarly, the length of diagonal links L11, L12, L13 and L14 were half of the link L7. 
 
𝐿11 = 𝐿12 = 𝐿13 = 𝐿14 = 1.662𝑚 
(4) 
The dimensions calculated for 14 different links that constitute the triple scissors links 
deployable modular unit are given in Table 1.

Stretch length, deploy/stow height, deploy/stow diameter, deploy/stow volume, and storage 
ratio calculations are carried out for antennas with 12, 18, and 24 modular modules while 
fixing the aperture at 25 meters. Table 2 illustrates how the structure can be set up with 
different numbers of modular pieces based on the necessary aperture size. Deformation 
evaluations of the 18 and 24 unit modular assemblies revealed substantial levels of structural 
instability, despite the fact that they provided a good compromise between efficient 
deployment and compact stowage. The antenna assembly, which consists of 12 modular 
parts, maintains a consistent deployed diameter of 25m while offering a greater deployed 
height of 5.122m. Additionally, it exhibits a minimal deformation of 0.01048mm without 
sacrificing structural integrity, which makes it more appropriate for the demands of our 
particular task.  In the proposed design, there are two independent variables.  The diameter of 
the antenna, which is determined by its intended function, is the first consideration.  The goal 
of this study is to create a large deployable antenna with a diameter of 20 to 30 meters. 
Consequently, a deployable antenna with a diameter of 25 meters has been chosen for this 
experiment. The height of each link, the length of a fully deployed unit, the length of 
moveable slots, and the diagonals are all determined by the second independent variable, or 
the number of modular units. Using SolidWorks, a full-scale assembly with 12 modular 
pieces and a 25-meter aperture was created. Each part, such as the center linkages and 
interconnected scissor mechanisms, was depicted in depth by this 3D assembly.

For link length (𝐿), angle (𝜃), overall width (𝑊), and height (𝐻), the stowed and deployed 
angles can be computed. The deployed and stowed states of modular mechanisms are 
calculated using the cosine laws, as shown in equations (5) and (6), respectively. 
 
𝑊= 𝐿√2(1 + cos (𝜃1) 
(5) 
 
𝐻= 𝐿√2(1 + cos (𝜃2) 
(6) 
Where θ1 and θ2 in the above equations are the deployed and stowed angles respectively. 
Substituting 𝑊 =  5.09𝑚 and 𝐿 =  3.32𝑚 in equation (1) verifies θ1 = 79.90° ≈ 80°. 
A table 5 and table 6 illustrates key measures of a deployable space truss mechanism 
demonstrating how different structural dimensions vary with increasing aperture size. 
Consistent scaling appears to be achieved; that is, larger apertures correspond to 
proportionally larger values of stretched length, deployed height, and deployed volume. This 
demonstrates that the mechanism has a modularity of structure design where uniform 
relationships between all units are achieved with increasing total size.  

A very critical part of this mechanism is that its stowed configurations are so different from 
its deployed configurations. This clearly reflects how compact the folded configuration can 
be to accommodate for storage and transport, because it's considerably shorter and thinner 
compared to the diameter of its deployment configuration. Stowed volume also differs, since 
it's quite a bit smaller than deployed volume, an aspect important for the success of missions 
in space: the use of payload capacity efficiently. Further confirming the design efficiency, 
there are the storage ratios. The latter is around 7.7 for diameter, meaning that the reduction 
factor is relatively uniform when the truss is stowed. For height, the storage ratio is 
constantly at 0.465, meaning that when stowed, it is always at 46.5% of deployed height. 
Most remarkably, for volume, at all aperture sizes, the storage ratio is at 27.6, representing 
that the deployed truss space in space would occupy 27.6 times more volume in its stowed 
form. In fact, over such a scale of aperture size, such consistent results re-emphasize the 
scalability and the reliability of this truss mechanism. In general, the table indicates that a 
deployable space truss mechanism was developed with the focus on having storage 
efficiency, predictable scalability, and optimized deployment. Uniform ratios in storage assert 
that it's a good engineering system, having the same adaptability to be achieved for 
applications in space structures, making the mechanism highly suited for space structures 
where compact storage and large dimension in deployment are critical.

Below is a summary of the measurement of a deployable space truss mechanism in the 
collapsed or without links configuration for comparison with the earlier configuration that 
included links. The data follows a scaling pattern where larger apertures translate to increases 
in stretched length, deployed height, and eventually a proportional rise in the deployed 
volume. Stowage dimensions along with storage ratio significantly differ pointing towards 
the effective role of a removed link about system compactness. In comparison to the linked 
configuration, the stowed height in the without links version is significantly lower, resulting 
in a higher storage ratio for height (0.765 vs. 0.465). This means that the without links 
structure is more compact in the stowed state. Furthermore, the stowed volume is much less, 
which leads to a remarkably increased storage ratio for volume (45.4 vs. 27.6), showing 
superior volumetric efficiency in the without links configuration. These notwithstanding, the 
storage ratio for diameter (~7.7) is the same for both configurations, indicating that folding 
behavior in the radial direction is not affected by the presence or absence of links. In general, 
the without links deployable space truss mechanism has superior storage efficiency, 
especially in terms of height and volume, thus making it a more compact and efficient 
alternative for space applications where minimizing stowed dimensions is a critical design 
consideration. 
Deployment Simulation SOLIDWORKS: 

The deployment sequence of the 12-module deployable structure's interconnected units, 
where each unit is connected to the next, is depicted in Fig. 3 For TSDTM, the entire cycle 
takes 102 seconds, and the stowed to fully deployed condition is reached in 53 seconds. Table 
3 presents the comparative study for the suggested 25m aperture TSDTM.

It can be observed that the deployment of proposed deployable mechanism is more efficient 
than the single ring and double ring truss antenna that required 140s and 102s, respectively, 
to achieve fully deployed state.

Mobility Analysis 
The novel deployable truss mechanism under investigation is designed to achieve a single 
degree of freedom (DoF) to facilitate controlled deployment and stowage. The mobility of the 
structure is determined using Gruebler’s equation for planar mechanisms: 
𝑀= 3(𝑛−1) −2𝑗𝑝−𝑗ℎ 
where M represents the degree of freedom, n is the total number of links, 𝑗𝑝 denotes the total 
number of primary joints (lower pairs), and 𝑗ℎ accounts for the higher-order joints. 
For the proposed truss structure, the following parameters have been determined: 𝑛=
18, 𝑗𝑝= 26, 𝑗ℎ= 0. 
Substituting these values into Gruebler’s equation: 
𝑀= 3(18 −1) −2(26) −0 
𝑀= 51 −52 
𝑀= 1 
This result confirms that the mechanism possesses a single degree of freedom, ensuring 
synchronized deployment through a single actuation input. Each modular segment of the truss 

operates independently in terms of kinematic motion, with overall synchronization facilitated 
via deployment cables. Consequently, the entire assembly maintains a DoF of 1, validating its 
suitability for deployable aerospace applications. 
Mesh and Mesh convergence study 
Fig. 5 shows the meshed geometry of the 12 modular units and 25m aperture TSDTM. The 
precise mesh of the deployable antenna mechanism ensures accuracy of results in the virtual 
experiments. The meshing performed in SolidWorks employed tetrahedrons to discretize the 
antenna assembly. The initial mesh consisted of 0.51 million with element quality of 0.5619 
that followed subsequent mesh refinements. For reliable analysis, the quality of the mesh was 
assessed considering the factors such as the skewness of the elements and their aspect ratio.  
 
Fig. 5 Meshed geometry for 12 modular units TSDTM assembly  
The results of the mesh convergence study and the change in the orthogonal quality after 
subsequent mesh refinements are shown in Fig. 6 and Table 4 respectively. This analysis 
reveals that further enhancement of the orthogonal quality to reduce skewness results in 
insignificant variation in the results but increases the time for computation. To find the ideal 
mesh density, indicating mesh-independent outcomes, a total of nine iterations were 
performed. The final mesh consisting of 1.56 million tetrahedral-shaped elements provided 
the best balance between computation speed and solution accuracy.

Kinematics Analysis 
In the mechanism two modular units exhibit a motion independent from each other. The 
motion of the mechanism depends on the speed of the deployment rope monitored by the 
speed of the electric motor. Therefore, the kinematic analysis is performed on a single unit 
model. An independent study of a unit module is sufficient and holds for each unit of the 
structure. The kinematic analysis is performed to determine, (a) The translational and angular

Assumptions & System Description 
 
Point “𝑂” is the only fixed point in the structure. 
 
Other points (𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶, … , 𝑄) have different constraints based on the system’s 
configuration. 
 
The structure follows Newtonian mechanics for kinematics. 
 
Velocity & acceleration relations are derived based on rigid-body assumptions. 
Translational Velocity Equations: 
For the fixed point: 
 
𝑉𝑂= 0 
(7) 
For the first moving point (A), the motion is given as 

 
𝑉𝐴= 𝑟𝜔𝜃 
(8) 
For subsequent points, the velocity propagates through linkages 
 
𝑉𝐵= 𝑉𝐴+ 𝑉𝐵/𝐴 
(9) 
For point C, the velocity equation will be 
 
𝑉𝐶= 𝑉𝐵+ 𝑉𝐶/𝐵 
(10) 
Similarly, for remaining points we can get velocity equations. 
Acceleration Equations 
Acceleration is split into normal (𝐴𝑥

Validation of analytical modelling using GA-SQP-NN and SolidWorks 
a) Technique for validation with GA-SQP-NN: 
A Genetic Algorithm (GA) starts with conjectures and then develops to improve them. 
Typically, a GA is divided into five sections, which are: 
1. Chromosome: In GAs, solutions are often encoded as a string of chromosomes. Every 
gene in the chromosome could represent a fraction of the solution. 
2. Initial Population: This is the starting set of chromosomes-population. Such a diverse 
starting population leaves much more hope for finding an optimal solution. 
3. The fitness function in this context computes how close the given chromosome is to 
the solution that one optimally desires. Fitness of chromosomes plays the most 
important role during the drive of evolution as fitter chromosomes are more likely to 
reproduce. 
4. Selection: This function takes chromosome candidates into the reproductive processes 
because of their fitness. Some of the common methods of selection are: tournament 
selection, roulette wheel selection, and rank selection. 
5. Crossover and Mutation Operators: These are the genetic operators which generate a 
new chromosome from the population. The crossover combines a bit of two parent 

chromosomes to form offspring while mutation introduces random variations to 
uphold the generation's diversity so that it doesn't converge too early. 
A chromosome in a GA is a data structure that can be variable in complexity from as simple 
as a binary string to very complex data arrangements depending on the problem that is to be 
solved. The population of chromosomes can be randomly generated or even manually taken 
up, hence providing diverse starting points for the algorithm. The fitness function shows how 
good each chromosome is at performing the task at hand compared to the desired goal or 
solution and thus guides the selection process. The mechanism of selection selects which 
chromosomes most probably reach the next generation after possibly undergoing genetic 
operations such as mutation and crossover. It is facilitated by the crossover operator, which 
allows the genetic material to be interchanged between two chromosomes, hence creating two 
offspring inheriting traits from both parents. This will enhance diversity and enable the 
exploration of varying solutions. It introduces randomness in the algorithm through mutation 
operators, which modify a portion or set of genes of a chromosome. Through this mechanism, 
the algorithm can see new possibilities and not get trapped in local optima. Hence, all these 
processes drive the evolutionary improvement of solutions in summary. GAs have a wide 
range of applications in a variety of areas include credit scoring model [20], heart disease 
diagnosis [21], image reconstruction [22], forecasting of crude oil price model [23], optical 
metasurfaces model [24], and mobile robot model for path planning [25]. 
This algorithm is a fusion between Genetic algorithm (GA) and Sequential Quadratic 
Programming (SQP) in order to optimize the weights of a Neural Network (NN). Table 5 is a 
step-by-step structured breakdown and description of how this algorithm can implemented 
for our scenario:

Figure 7 illustrates the kinematic analysis of TSDTM, comparing SolidWorks simulations 
with optimization-based approaches. The graphs show a smooth decline in linear and angular 
velocity, as well as acceleration. This indicates a stable deployment. The close match 
between simulation and optimization results confirms the accuracy and efficiency of the 
mechanism. 
Analytical Dynamics 
 The deployable structure consists of 12 identical units forming a circular structure. 
 Each unit has mass m, and they all move as the structure stows or deploys. 
 The motion causes a change in radius 𝑅 and height 𝐿 of each unit. 
 We describe the motion using an angular displacement 𝜃. 
 We used small angle approximations i.e. 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 ≈ 𝜃 and 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃 ≈ 𝜃. 
Each unit has two types of motion contributing to kinetic energy: 

1. Radial motion (change in 𝑅) 
2. Vertical motion (change in 𝐿) 
From geometry: 
 The radial displacement of each unit is proportional to 𝑅0𝜃. 
 The vertical displacement is proportional to 𝐿𝜃.

In ANSYS, we conducted simulation of dynamic analysis across multiple antenna structures, 
in order to determine their natural frequencies. The simulation results are illustrated in Fig. 8

configuration.

The table provides a comparison between the natural frequency and frequency response of 
the simulation of the deployable space truss mechanism as a function of mass and aperture 
size. In both configurations, with the increase in the size of the aperture, the mass increases 
and, therefore, causes the natural frequency to decrease correspondingly. Notably, the 
“without links” configuration has higher frequency values compared to the “with links” 
configuration, that is, a stiffer yet vibrationally more sensitive structure. For instance, at an 
aperture of 6m, the frequency is 0.2266 Hz (with links) and 0.35417 Hz (without links), and 
at 30m, it decreases to 0.09527 Hz (with links) and 0.12019 Hz (without links). The coupled 
frame, although potentially to provide strength, has some extra mass to affect its dynamic 
response. The uncoupled frame gives more stiffness and elevated frequency, and the coupled 
structure gives lower frequency response due to extra mass and potential flexural activities.

Resonance is a critical factor in determining the structural stability and performance. When 
natural frequency aligns with external excitations, excessive vibrations can occur which can 
lead to structural failure. As the requirements of this antenna are highly precise due to space 
applications, it is important to analyze the natural frequencies to ensure they remain above 
the range of operational and environmental disturbances such as micro-vibrations from 
spacecraft mechanics and thermal fluctuations. 
Typical spacecraft-induced disturbances range from 0.01 Hz to 10 Hz, meaning the antenna’s 
natural frequency should be designed well above this range to avoid resonance. Advanced 
damping techniques and structural optimization, such as increasing hinge stiffness or 
implementing tuned mass dampers, can reduce resonance effects. 
Material and Geometry Optimization 
To meet the stringent weight and strength requirements of space missions, this section 
focuses on material selection and geometry optimization. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
is used to identify suitable materials under LEO thermal conditions, while a Neural Network 
coupled with gradient-based methods is employed to refine geo- metric parameters. The 
optimized results demonstrate improved frequency response, reduced mass, and enhanced 

deformation resistance, confirming the potential of AI- based optimization in deployable 
structural design. 
Material Selection and Optimization 
In the structural design of aerospace structures, especially those for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) 
applications, material selection is an important choice with a direct impact on performance, 
safety, and mission life. Materials need to endure the extreme ther- mal, mechanical, and 
environmental conditions of space, including extreme variations of temperature and exposure 
to radiation. In order to systematically determine ap- propriate materials, a data-driven 
strategy was utilized based on a combination of mechanical properties (tensile strength, 
Young’s modulus, and density) and thermal limits (upper and lower operating temperatures). 
The process of selection commenced by creating a dataset of prospective materials, with each 
material characterized by key performance indicators. In order to identify suitability under 
LEO environments, materials were initially filtered according to thermal survivability, that is, 
a mini- mum of -100°C and a maximum requirement of at least 150°C. Such limits are the 
typical operating extremes found in space. In order to augment decision-making, a supervised 
machine learning method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), was learned on normalized 
mechanical features for the purpose of determining whether a material was suitable or 
unsuitable. Of the materials categorized as suitable, an optimization scoring function was 
used to determine the optimal material. The scoring function favored high tensile strength 
and modulus and low density to combine both structural strength and mass efficiency. This 
process not only guarantees thermal compatibility but also maximizes mechanical 
performance, offering a strong and efficient method- ology for material selection for space 
applications. The details of the materials are given table below.

Through the use of the material selection and optimization algorithm outlined above, the list 
of candidate materials was tested against both thermal performance and mechanical 
performance specifications. Once filtered for applicability under Low Earth Orbit (LEO) 
conditions—namely, materials that can sustain temperatures above 150°C and below -
100°C—only a limited number of materials were able to meet the necessary thermal 
thresholds. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was trained on the normalized 
mechanical properties to classify material appropri- ateness, and the model validated these 
thermally qualified candidates. To define the best material, an optimization score for each 
appropriate material was calculated with regard to tensile strength, Young’s modulus, and 
density, focusing on maximiz- ing the mechanical performance while minimizing weight. 
Among all the materials, Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) was found to be the best 
material due to its strength-to-weight ratio and stiffness. To further confirm this choice, a 
deformation analysis presented in Figure below was conducted under simulated LEO loading 
conditions. The analysis showed that CFRP had the minimum deformation among all 
materials, proving its highest structural integrity and dimensional stability in space. This 
verification emphasizes CFRP’s ability to be used in aerospace applications in which 
mechanical performance and thermal resistance are paramount.

Geometry Optimization 
Machine learning (ML) based geometry optimization of truss structures is a state of the art 
method that combines computational intelligence and structural engineering to obtain 
efficient, lightweight, and durable structures. Geometric optimization of trusses classically 
means iterative numerical approaches to optimize material use while meeting strength, 
stability, and deformation requirements. These procedures can be costly in terms of 
computation, particularly for large and intricate truss systems. Machine learning presents a 
strong alternative through learning from past design experience data or simulation output 

to forecast best geometries more effectively. In deployable space antenna design for large 
apertures, structural geometry is central to dynamic performance and deployment 
efficiency determination. One of the main challenges is to optimize the geometry 
specifically the radius and individual link lengths such that it becomes dynamically stable 
and meets stringent mass and frequency requirements. This work introduces a gradient-
based optimization method through Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) to reduce 
the natural frequency of the deployable antenna such that the radius is greater than a 
predetermined limit and the generated frequency is within manageable operating limits. 
Through the incorporation of geometric parameters, contributions to the inertia, and 
mechanical limitations into a single optimization platform, the technique offers a 
systematic approach to the trade-off of stiffness, mass distribution, and deployability. The 
importance of this method is that it can produce light weight, low frequency structures to 
deploy space without sacrificing structural integrity or accuracy. 
 
The optimized radius is 13.65m, optimized frequency 0.1107Hz and optimized lengths which 
are presented in Table.

Dynamic Analysis of Optimized TSDTM 
 
In ANSYS, we performed simulation of dynamic analysis across antenna structure of a 27.3 
m aperture, to determine their natural frequency. The simulation results are illustrated in 
Figure 9.5 for optimized TSDTM antenna. The modal analysis reveals a natural frequency of 
0.10859 Hz for the structure.

Comparison of Optimized Frequency and Simulation 
The modal analysis calculated the natural frequency of the structure as 0.10859 Hz, while the 
machine learning optimized frequency was 0.1107 Hz. The absolute difference between the 
two frequencies is 0.00211 Hz, and the relative difference is about 1.94%. This minor 

difference infers the high degree of accuracy and credibility of the machine learning model in 
the prediction of structural dynamic behavior, with excellent closeness to the results of 
traditional simulation methodologies. 
Conclusion: 
This paper presents the TSDTM as an advanced solution for large-aperture deployable 
antennas. First through kinematic and dynamic analyses, validated by simulations in MSC 
ADAMS and ANSYS, it is proven beyond any reasonable doubt that the mechanism is far 
more compact, structurally stable, and deployable than its counterparts. Considered results 
show that it has high natural frequency, which would guarantee it to resist resonant vibrations 
when applied in space. Further work, therefore, will be directed at enhancing performance 
optimization leading to real-world structural deployment actuation reliability improvements.
