ABSTRACT
Context. The Circinus galaxy is the nearest type-2 Seyfert galaxy, which is at a distance of 4.2 Mpc. Its environment is challenging
to explore because this galaxy is located at low Galactic latitudes, behind the disc of the Milky Way.
Aims. The long-term goal is to characterise the Circinus galaxy halo, and we are interested in determining the possible presence of
dwarf satellites using near-infrared data.
Methods. We selected 1,542 galaxies from the VVV near-IR galaxy catalogue within a 2-degree radius around the Circinus galaxy,
representing roughly 2/3 of the virial radius. Structural parameters such as half-light radii and colours were used, and correlations
were examined. A neural network was trained with 486 galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts in order to estimate photometric
redshifts for all of these galaxies. Potential satellites of the Circinus galaxy were defined based on half-light radii compatible with the
typical sizes of dwarf satellites in galaxies, and combined with photometric redshifts.
Results. The galaxy properties are reliably characterised down to Ks ∼15.5 mag, which represents about 90% completeness of the
detections. At the distance of the Circinus galaxy, this limiting magnitude corresponds to Ks absolute magnitude of −12.6 mag, which
allows us to find dwarf galaxies. There are 20 galaxies with half-light radii larger than 2.45 arcsec, however, only 8 of these have
photometric redshifts below 0.04. None of these galaxies is close to the Circinus galaxy, which has a redshift of 0.0015, thus showing
no evidence of associated clustering. The ANNz model exhibited a high degree of accuracy in the range of 0.001 < zphot < 0.023,
therefore validating this method in these extinct regions.
Conclusions. The presence of dwarf satellites associated with the Circinus galaxy could not be confirmed with the available data in
the studied region. The apparent lack of satellites may be genuine, possibly related to AGN feedback effects. Nevertheless, this work
demonstrates the effectiveness of combining near-infrared data and machine learning techniques to estimate photometric redshifts at
low Galactic latitudes, thus providing useful information for future spectroscopic follow-up campaigns.

1. Introduction
The Circinus galaxy (ESO 97-G13) is a nearby spiral galaxy
located at J2000 coordinates RA = 14h 13m 09s.906, Dec =
−65◦20′20.47′′ (l = 311.326◦, b = −3.808◦). It is among the
nearest active galaxies to the Milky Way (MW), at a distance of
D = 4.2 Mpc (Tully et al. 2009). The Circinus galaxy is classi-
fied as SA(s)b, being an unbarred spiral galaxy with moderately
wound arms and hosting a type-2 Seyfert nucleus which exhibits
narrow emission lines and an obscured active galactic nucleus
(AGN, Oliva et al. 1994; Maiolino et al. 1998; Stalevski et al.
2017). The systemic velocity of the galaxy is 439 km/s based on
HI measurements reported by Jones et al. (1999), corresponding
to a redshift of 0.0015. The total stellar mass of the galaxy was
estimated by For et al. (2012) to be 9.5 × 1010 M⊙. Using the
stellar mass-halo mass relation (Behroozi et al. 2010), the Circi-
nus halo mass is approximately 1 × 1013 M⊙. The logarithm of
Ks luminosity of the galaxy in solar units, corrected for extinc-
tion, is 10.60 (Karachentsev et al. 2013), with the virial radius
being 220 kpc (Mutlu-Pakdil et al. 2021).
The study of the Circinus galaxy presents considerable chal-
lenges due to its location at low latitudes behind the Galactic
disc, where the effects of interstellar extinction and crowding
are particularly pronounced. The majority of previous research
has been focused on its active galactic nucleus, super-massive
black hole (Smith & Wilson 2001), and X-ray emission (An-
donie et al. 2022), with a few studies conducted on optical pass-
bands. The distribution of gas in the Circinus galaxy exhibits an
asymmetric pattern, which might be indicative of galaxy inter-
actions (Jones et al. 1999). According to the nearby galaxy cat-

alogue (Karachentsev et al. 2013), there are 32 galaxies within
a velocity range of ± 200 km/s relative to the Circinus galaxy,
with the closest of these galaxies being located at an angular
separation of 16 degrees, corresponding to a distance of approx-
imately 1.1 Mpc. The galaxy HI-ZOA J1353-58 was identified
by Staveley-Smith et al. (2016) as being a potential companion
of the Circinus galaxy. It is less than 8 degrees, or about 3 virial
radii, from the Circinus galaxy, and has a recessional velocity
difference of about 200 km s−1.
In Bullock & Boylan-Kolchin (2017) review on challenges
at small scales to the standard cosmological model, known as
the Λ Cold Dark Matter paradigm, one of the most prominent is-
sues discussed is the problem of missing satellites (Klypin et al.
1999). Understanding the distribution of satellites in galaxies is
therefore a key factor in galaxy formation models. Identification
of satellite galaxies beyond the Local Group represents a signifi-
cant challenge, even in relatively nearby galaxies with distances
smaller than 4 Mpc (e.g., Webster et al. 1979; Rejkuba et al.
2007; Crnojevi´c et al. 2014, 2016; Martínez-Delgado et al. 2021;
Mutlu-Pakdil et al. 2022, 2024; Doliva-Dolinsky et al. 2025b).
Using simulated galaxies to be observed at the Rubin Obser-
vatory, Mutlu-Pakdil et al. (2021) studied dwarf detection effi-
ciencies for a variety of distances, luminosities, and sizes, and
identified regions in the luminosity-size space where the galaxy
satellites should be located. Galaxies with similar stellar masses
as the Circinus galaxy show a wide dispersion in the number of
confirmed satellites. For instance, the MW and Andromeda host
49 and 39 satellites, respectively (Smercina et al. 2018), while
M94 has only two within 150 kpc. This scatter is not unexpected
as it might reflect both the intrinsic stochasticity in halo assem-
bly histories and the varying impact of baryonic feedback pro-
cesses, such as AGN-driven outflows, which can suppress the
formation of faint satellites.
The VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea survey (VVV, Min-
niti et al. 2010) and its extension (VVVX, Saito et al. 2024) were
designed to map the Galactic bulge and disc in ZYJHKs and
JHKs near-infrared (NIR) passbands, respectively. These sur-
veys reached 5σ depths of Ks ∼17.5 – 18.0 magnitudes, cov-
ering 560 square degrees for the VVV survey and 1200 square
degrees for the VVVX survey. Data were obtained using the
Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA;
Emerson et al. 2006) 4.1 m telescope at the Paranal Observatory
of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Chile, equipped
with the VISTA InfraRed CAMera (VIRCAM). The main goal
of both surveys was to monitor the variability of different types
of stars and to determine the three-dimensional structure of the
MW. The NIR observations also mitigate the issues of interstel-
lar extinction and stellar crowding, thereby offering a distinctive
opportunity for detecting and studying galaxies situated beyond
the Galactic plane.
Obasi et al. (2023, 2024) searched and characterised the
Circinus globular cluster (GC) system. NIR and optical imag-
ing, in conjunction with data from the Gaia mission (Gaia Col-
laboration et al. 2016), have been used to reveal a population of
111 GC candidates. However, perhaps the most striking finding
was that the Circinus galaxy is potentially the host of a large GC
system that may extend up to several tens of kpc. A few galax-
ies have been identified in the Circinus surroundings, but so far
no known satellites have been confirmed. In the Circinus region,
there is considerable interstellar extinction (central AV = 3.96
or AKs = 0.47 mag, Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011) but the NIR
windows present a distinctive and relatively unpolluted vantage
point. Nevertheless, the density of the foreground stellar popula-
tion presents an additional challenge.
Baravalle et al. (2018) proposed a methodology employing
SExtractor + PSFEx (Bertin 2011) on VVV and VVVX im-
ages to identify galaxies behind the Galactic disc. The extended
objects were separated from point sources that satisfied morpho-
logical criteria based on the stellar index (CLASS_STAR), the
SPREAD_MODEL (Φ) parameter, the radius that contains 50%
of the total flux of an object (R1/2), and the concentration index
(C, Conselice et al. 2000). The possible extragalactic sources
also met photometric criteria based on Ks magnitudes and NIR
colours. This procedure has been successfully employed in the
following: The VVV NIRGC I catalogue (Baravalle et al. 2021),
comprising 5,554 galaxies that underwent visual inspection in
the inner regions of the southern Galactic disc, and the VVV
NIRGC II catalogue (Daza-Perilla et al. 2023), incorporating
1,003 galaxies from the northern portion of the Galactic disc.
In order to mitigate the occurrence of false detections, a convo-
lutional neural network was implemented to analyse the VVVX
images (IS-CNN), and a gradient boosting model was utilized
on the photometric and morphological data (PS-XGBoost). The
catalogue included both probability classifiers, and all galaxies
were also subjected to a visual inspection. The most recent pub-
lication, the VVV NIRGC III catalogue (Alonso et al. 2025),
presents a total of 167,559 galaxies that were identified in the
VVVX region of the southern Galactic disc, with the probabil-
ities associated with each galaxy being derived from machine
learning algorithms. Altogether, the southern Galactic disc cat-
alogues contain 173,113 galaxies, of which only 493 galaxies
have spectroscopic redshifts, and 3,670 have photometric red-
shifts. Throughout this work, the galaxies from the VVV NIRGC
I and III catalogues will be referred to as VVV NIRGC galax-
ies, and their morphological and photometric parameters will be
used in the analysis.
At low Galactic latitudes, the need for spectroscopic surveys
in the NIR is becoming increasingly evident. There are some
HI surveys such as MeerKAT (Goedhart et al. 2024) and WAL-
LABY (Koribalski et al. 2020; Westmeier et al. 2022), but more
redshift measurements of galaxies need to be obtained in the
VVV and VVVX disc regions. While spectroscopic redshifts of-
fer the highest precision, especially in the Local Universe, their
acquisition becomes extremely challenging in regions heavily
obscured by the Galactic plane.
Photometric redshift (zphot) estimations have emerged as a
powerful methodology for studying galaxies in regions where
spectroscopic observations are either limited or unfeasible. The
applicability of photometric techniques at very low redshifts
is supported by previous studies. For instance, Marleau et al.
(2008) used mid- to far-infrared surveys such as the Galactic
Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE,
Benjamin et al. 2003) and MIPS Galactic Plane Survey (MIPS-
GAL, Carey 2008), and successfully reported the discovery of
25 previously unknown galaxies at low latitudes in the Sagitta-
Aquila region (l ∼47 −55◦and |b| ≲1◦), obtaining photomet-
ric redshifts in the z ≃0.01 −0.05 range. This demonstrates
the feasibility of this technique for mapping the galaxy distri-
bution in the zone of avoidance. In addition, recent studies have
revealed the robustness of zphot at low redshifts when precise cal-
ibration procedures are employed. Shuntov et al. (2020), for ex-
ample, used convolutional neural networks trained on the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (Alam et al. 2015), and by incorporating
the k-nearest neighbours approach from Beck et al. (2017) and
using spectroscopic redshifts from Galaxy and Mass Assembly
(GAMA, Baldry et al. 2018) derived zphot with median absolute
deviations of ≃0.009 for r < 17.8 mag at a redshift of 0.1.
Similarly, Cerdosino et al. (2024) utilised a machine learning

approach, namely the Bayesian Mixture Density Networks, with
the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey Data Release
4 (Herpich et al. 2024) data, and estimated photometric redshifts
to identify isolated galaxy pairs with typical zphot ∼0.04 −0.25,
achieving uncertainties of around ∼0.01.
In this study, we use morphological and photometric proper-
ties of the VVV NIRGC galaxies to address the satellite popula-
tion of the Circinus galaxy, employing photometric redshift esti-
mates to discard foreground galaxies. This paper is organised as
follows: Sect. 2 presents the VVV and VVVX data together with
surveys at other wavelengths. The search for satellite galaxies
using the available photometry is discussed in Sect. 3. The pho-
tometric redshift procedure is described in detail in Sect. 4. The
distribution of galaxies around the Circinus galaxy is addressed
in Sect. 5, and finally, the main conclusions are highlighted in
Sect. 6.
2. The data
The Circinus galaxy is located at low Galactic latitudes (b =
−3.808◦). In this region, significant obscuration due to dust and
stellar density from our own Galaxy contributes with high inter-
stellar extinction. At the Circinus distance, the virial radius of
220 kpc subtends an angular radius of approximately 3 degrees
in the sky. This angular size is indicative of a circular region
surrounding the Circinus galaxy, within which a satellite system
could be found.
2.1. The VVV NIRGC galaxies
The VVV and VVVX surveys do not completely cover the circu-
lar region of a 3-degree radius around the Circinus galaxy. Thus,
as a compromise, we defined an area within a 2-degree radius of
the galaxy, which is covered by a small part of the VVV survey
down to Galactic latitudes of −2.25◦. The remaining part is re-
stricted to Galactic latitudes of b ≤−4.5◦, which corresponds to
the limits of the VVVX survey. Figure 1 shows this area around
the Circinus galaxy in Galactic coordinates as a grey dashed cir-
cle, and throughout the present work, we will refer to this as the
studied region. The background is colour-coded by the AV inter-
stellar extinction, and the Circinus galaxy is represented by an
ellipse with semi-major and minor axes of 3.5 and 1.15 arcmin,
respectively, estimated from the Ks image of the VVVX survey.
The studied region represents a circular area of about 2/3
of the Circinus virial radius, which is appropriate for searching
for satellites of this galaxy. We selected 26 galaxies from VVV
NIRGC I and 1,516 from VVV NIRGC III. Both catalogues in-
clude the galaxy positions together with their NIR photometry,
JHKs magnitudes and colours, and with morphological param-
eters such as half-light radius (R1/2), concentration index (C),
ellipticity (ϵ), and the Sersic index (n, Sersic 1968). In total, the
1,542 VVV NIRGC galaxies were visually inspected using J,
H, and Ks images, as was carried out for VVV NIRGC I (Bar-
avalle et al. 2021). The galaxies are located in reddened regions
of the Galactic disc, with estimated interstellar extinction val-
ues ranging from AV = 1.5 to 9 mag, equivalent to AKs = 0.18
to 1.06 mag. The VVV NIRGC III (Alonso et al. 2025) reaches
16.0 mag and, due to the extinction limitations, the magnitude
distribution of the galaxies around Circinus reaches Ks = 15.5
mag, which corresponds to a completeness of 90% of the detec-
tions. Considering the Circinus distance of 4.2 Mpc, the limiting
magnitude of 15.5 mag corresponds to an absolute magnitude
MKs = −12.6 mag. Therefore, we can study the satellite popula-
tion expected to be found around the Circinus galaxy.
A search was conducted for previously known galaxies in the
studied region around the Circinus galaxy using the SIMBAD as-
tronomical database (Wenger et al. 2000). A total of 21 galaxies
were identified, with the exclusion of a few duplicate entries and
some background QSOs. Only seven of these galaxies have esti-
mated radial velocities, of which the following three are included
in the VVV NIRGC III catalogue: LEDA 166334 (2999 ± 70
km/s), ESO 97-12 (3127 ± 92 km/s), and 2MASX J14054516-
6541032 (3024 ± 157 km/s) from Fairall et al. (1998). These
galaxies are located at a significant distance from the Circinus
galaxy, whose systemic velocity is 439 km/s (Jones et al. 1999).
We also searched for galaxies with available radial velocities
in the complete area of the 2-degree radius around the Circi-
nus galaxy that is not covered by the VVV and VVVX surveys.
There are 4 additional galaxies reported by Staveley-Smith et al.
(2016) within the radial velocity range of 1647 to 8490 km/s
clearly distant from the Circinus galaxy.
Figure 1 also shows the distribution of the selected 1,542
VVV NIRGC galaxies in the studied region around the Circi-
nus galaxy. These galaxies are represented by black circles, with
the only three galaxies with available radial velocities indicated
by blue triangles. The 111 globular cluster candidates studied
by Obasi et al. (2023, 2024) are shown as red circles. A dis-
cernible interstellar extinction gradient as a function of Galac-
tic latitude is evident, with a general decrease in the number of
galaxies towards the inner parts of the Galactic disc, which is
also a consequence of increasing interstellar extinction. On ex-
amining the AV interstellar extinctions versus the NIR magni-
tudes of VVV NIRGC galaxies, it is clear that the sample of
galaxies becomes progressively more incomplete with increas-
ing interstellar extinction. The spatial distribution of galaxies is
non-uniform, with clear empty regions and some clustered ob-
jects. Despite the identification of a few galaxy groups at these
low latitudes, the distribution does not solely reflect genuine
clustering but also the impact of differential reddening.
2.2. Galaxies with photometry in optical, near- and mid-IR
wavelengths
The Dark Energy Camera Galactic Plane Survey (DECaPS2,
Schlafly et al. 2018) is a five-band optical and NIR survey of
the southern Galactic plane with the Dark Energy Camera on
the 4.0 m Blanco telescope, covering the very faint magnitudes:
g < 23.5, r < 22.6, i < 22.1, z < 21.6, and Y < 20.8 mag (Sayd-
jari et al. 2023). We cross-matched our galaxies in the region of
the Circinus galaxy, and identified 1,541 galaxies in common us-
ing an angular separation of 1 arcsec. Only 1,039 (67%) of these
galaxies have photometry in the five passbands, and more than
90% have some NIR magnitudes. Of the total, 1,085 galaxies
(70%) have g magnitudes located in regions with lower inter-
stellar extinctions.
The Gaia satellite of the European Space Agency (Gaia Col-
laboration et al. 2016) has released an updated large optical sur-
vey, Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3, Gaia Collaboration et al.
2021), which provides homogeneous astrometry and photome-
try for sources with G < 21 mag across the entire sky. In par-
ticular, Gaia DR3 contains some automatic classifiers, such as
galaxies and QSOs in the database (Delchambre et al. 2023). It
is not expected that Gaia detects extended sources as galaxies,
but more compact and concentrated galaxies that are sufficiently
bright should match well with our galaxies. Exploring the stud-
ied region around the Circinus galaxy, we identified 323 VVV
NIRGC galaxies that cross-match with the Gaia DR3 database
using an angular separation of 1 arcsec. There is a good overlap

of the matched sources that are brighter and bluer, while Gaia
misses a large number of the fainter and redder sources, as ex-
pected.
The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mission (WISE;
Wright et al. 2010) mapped the whole sky in the mid-IR: 3.4,
4.6, 12, and 22 µm passbands. The VVV NIRGC galaxies were
cross-matched with WISE data with an angular separation of 1
arcsec. In the area surrounding the Circinus galaxy, there are 177
galaxies with WISE counterparts. For these galaxies, the median
half-light radius is R1/2 = 1.32 ± 0.90 arcsec, a larger value than
that found for the rest of the galaxies in the studied region, which
is R1/2 = 0.83 ± 0.39 arcsec. Also, these galaxies are one magni-
tude brighter for Ks magnitudes, with a median of 13.94 ± 1.10
mag.
3. Searching for Circinus satellites with the
available photometry
3.1. Colour-colour diagrams
Figure 2 shows the NIR colour-colour diagram (CCD) for the
1,542 VVV NIRGC galaxies selected in the studied region
around the Circinus galaxy (left panel). The optical CCD for the
1,085 VVV NIRGC galaxies with g magnitudes from DECaPS2
is displayed in the right panel. In general, there are no clear ten-
dencies based on these diagrams. However, higher dispersions
are found for galaxies located in regions with higher interstellar
extinctions, with g magnitudes being more affected.
Mid-IR WISE colours are often used to select galaxies with
active nuclei (Jarrett et al. 2011; Stern et al. 2012; Assef et al.
2018). These galaxies present a redder (3.4 - 4.6) colour for non-
active galaxies since warm dust emission is more determinant
than the light coming from the old stellar population in the host
galaxy (Ceccarelli et al. 2022). The (4.6 - 12) colour can also be
used to identify star-forming and passive galaxies, with values of
(4.6 - 12) > 3 mag and (4.6 -12) < 1.5 mag, respectively (Jarrett
et al. 2017). Using these criteria, of the 177 NIRGC galaxies
with WISE data, we identified 85 star-forming (SF) galaxies and
33 passive (P) ones around the Circinus galaxy. Moreover, six
galaxies satisfy the criteria of Assef et al. (2018) and Stern et al.
(2012) to be QSO candidates, while one galaxy falls within the
box defined by Jarrett et al. (2011) as an AGN candidate.
3.2. Sizes and structural parameters
Within the Local volume, satellite galaxies are generally divided
into dwarf satellites with radii of 0.05 to 0.5 kpc and larger satel-
lites with radii of 0.5 to 1.5 kpc (Müller & Jerjen 2020). At the
distance of the Circinus galaxy, these physical scales translate to
an angular radius of 2.45 to 24.58 arcsec for dwarf satellites and
24.68 to 73.74 arcsec for larger satellites, thereby providing an
observational reference for potential satellite candidates.
Figure 3 shows the half-light radius distribution for VVV
NIRGC galaxies around the Circinus galaxy. The lower limit of
typical dwarf satellites in the Local volume in arcseconds, at the
Circinus distance, is included in the figure. Although the major-
ity of objects are likely to be background galaxies, 20 galax-
ies exhibit a half-light radius in the range of 2.45 < R1/2 <
5.46 arcsec. These angular sizes are comparable to the typical
physical sizes of dwarf galaxies with radii of 0.05 to 0.5 kpc,

J141829.93-643221.4) and one as a passive galaxy (VVVX-
J140339.44-653516.1).
There is a wide range of ellipticities measured for galax-
ies of all magnitudes and sizes, although the vast majority of
the most concentrated galaxies tend to be rounder. The VVV
NIRGC galaxies also possess a wide range of Sersic indices,
which are comparatively independent of their NIR magnitudes.
Table 1 shows the median values of the extinction-corrected Ks
magnitudes and colours and the morphological parameters R1/2,
C, ϵ, and n for the 1,542 galaxies around the Circinus galaxy
and for the 85 SF and 33 P galaxies defined with the WISE data.
We did not find any clear trend between the morphological pa-
rameters of the galaxies and the angular distance to the Circinus
galaxy.
4. Photometric redshifts using VVV and VVVX data
Photometric redshift estimations have become an essential tool
for investigating galaxies in areas of the sky where spectroscopic
data are scarce. This is particularly relevant at low Galactic lati-
tudes, where the VVV and VVVX surveys facilitated the detec-
tion of a significant number of extragalactic objects and provided
their NIR photometry. Estimating redshifts for the galaxies in
the studied region around the Circinus galaxy allows us to ex-
plore their distribution. In these regions, although spectroscopic
redshifts are unavailable, well-calibrated photometric methods
provide a valid initial step for filtering and prioritising candi-

date galaxies. Our specific method employs traditional machine
learning with JHKs photometry and local training.
In order to estimate redshifts, it is necessary to have a sample
of galaxies that possesses consistent and complete photometric
coverage, as well as spectroscopic information. Cross-matching
with other surveys, such as DECaPS2, Gaia, and WISE, yielded
valuable multi-wavelength data. However, it was found that only
a small fraction (less than 1%) of the galaxies had simultane-
ous detections, for example, in the three NIR passbands of the
VVV and VVVX surveys and all five DECaPS2 optical pass-
bands. This limitation led to a substantial reduction in the statis-
tical representativeness of the expanded multi-passband dataset.
Consequently, we chose to prioritise the analysis of the internal
photometric data from the VVV and VVVX surveys. By focus-
ing on the J, H, and Ks passbands, we were able to retain a sub-
stantially larger sample with homogeneous coverage, which is
crucial for training a robust and reliable machine learning model.
This strategy allowed us to estimate photometric redshifts for
the 1,542 galaxies in the studied region, preserving the statisti-
cal power of the sample while ensuring consistency in the input
features.

4.1. Methodology and the use of the ANNz Code
The Artificial Neural Network for Photometric Redshifts (ANNz
V2.3.1, Sadeh et al. 2016) code is a machine learning tool specif-
ically designed for photometric redshift estimations. The neu-
ral network model is trained using a sample of galaxies with
known spectroscopic redshifts and photometric measurements.
Once trained, this model can predict the redshift of galaxies
based solely on their photometric properties.
In order to train the ANNz model for the VVV and VVVX
data, a sample of 486 galaxies with known spectroscopic red-
shifts, and photometry in the J, H, and Ks passbands was used.
These passbands are crucial for capturing the relevant spectral
information needed for accurate redshift estimations. To ensure a
reliable model, the sample was divided into three subsets: train-
ing (228 galaxies), validation (142 galaxies), and testing (116
galaxies). This division helps prevent overfitting and allows for
a robust evaluation of the model’s performance. The calibra-
tion of the subsets is used to train the neural network, adjust-
ing its parameters to minimise the errors in redshift predictions.
The validation set is used to monitor the model’s performance
during training, helping to avoid overfitting and tuning hyper-
parameters. The test set is then used to evaluate the final model’s
predictive ability, thereby providing an estimate of the error in
the predicted photometric redshifts.
The combination of the three J, H, and Ks passbands, along
with their corresponding colour combinations (J −Ks, H −Ks,
and J −H), has been shown to provide additional spectral
information, improving the model’s ability to distinguish be-
tween galaxies with different properties, especially distant ones.
Consequently, the model can accurately estimate the photomet-
ric redshifts. The resulting ANNz architecture adopted here, is
6:12:12:12:1, which used an input layer of six parameters: three
NIR magnitudes and three colours. This feeds into three hidden
layers, each of which processes data, using two different mathe-
matical methods to contribute 12 units per method per layer (12,
12, 12). A single output layer then provides the final result.
Figure 4 shows the calibration results of the ANNz code. The
solid line represents the one-to-one relation between spectro-
scopic and photometric redshifts. The highest degree of agree-
ment is observed in the redshift range 0.001 < z < 0.023,
where the scatter and uncertainties are significantly reduced.
This improvement in performance can be attributed primarily to
the larger number of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts avail-
able in this redshift range, thereby enhancing the training and
reliability of the photometric redshift estimates. However, for
z < 0.001, the number of spectroscopic sources drops signifi-
cantly. Our study shows that this technique is valuable for esti-
mating photometric redshifts in regions of high interstellar ex-
tinction, thereby opening up the possibility of studying galaxies
without spectroscopic measurements.
4.2. Photometric redshift results
We characterised the photometric redshift distribution of galax-
ies around the Circinus galaxy and quantify contamination from
foreground and background sources. Figure 5 shows the dis-
tribution of photometric redshifts obtained for the 1,542 VVV
NIRGC galaxies in the studied region around the Circinus
galaxy. The median value of the distribution is 0.075±0.012, and
most of the galaxies are clearly background galaxies, with red-
shifts that extend well beyond that of the Circinus galaxy. Only
four galaxies in the sample have estimated photometric redshifts

cates the one-to-one relation between spectroscopic and photometric
redshifts. The red points represent the mean photometric redshift within
each spectroscopic redshift bin, with error bars indicating the standard
deviation. The pink shaded region shows the calculated uncertainties in
the distribution.

the range of 2.45 < R1/2 < 5.46 arcsec, there are only eight with

redshift. The uncertainties in zphot are ∼±0.005 in all cases. Fig-
ure 7 shows the colour-composed images of these galaxies where
it can be seen that they do not look like typical dwarf satellites.
Figure 8 shows the absolute magnitude distribution in the
Ks passband (MKs) for the 1,542 VVV NIRGC galaxies derived
using the estimated photometric redshifts of the galaxies around
the Circinus galaxy. The median value is -22.50 ± 0.64 mag, rep-
resented by the blue line. Table 3 shows the median, minimum,
and maximum absolute Ks magnitudes, together with half-light
radii for the possible satellites of the Circinus galaxy: for the 20
galaxies with R1/2 > 2.45 arcsec, equivalent to 0.05 kpc, as well
as the 8 galaxies with zphot < 0.04. The latter are in the range of
-25.05 to -23.39 in absolute Ks magnitudes and 2.79 to 5.46 arc-
sec in half-light radius, which are translated into physical units of
0.05 to 0.11 kpc. These objects are far from the regions where the
dwarf satellites are located in the size–luminosity phase space
(Mutlu-Pakdil et al. 2021; Doliva-Dolinsky et al. 2025a). Fur-
thermore, based on the photometric redshifts estimated in this
work, no candidates were found that could be considered satel-
lite galaxies of the Circinus galaxy.
This study demonstrates the potential of this approach to
probe galaxy populations in regions where optical spectroscopy
is severely limited by interstellar extinction and stellar crowd-
ing. Although the uncertainties in the photometric redshifts are
high, with values of about 0.005, the galaxy with the lowest pho-
tometric redshift presents a zphot = 0.0148, which is far from the
Circinus galaxy (at z = 0.0015).
5. The distribution of galaxies around the Circinus
galaxy
The photometric redshift estimates for the VVV NIRGC galax-
ies in the studied region, together with their spatial distribution
in the sky, allow us to search for potential spatial groupings or
local overdensities of galaxies around the Circinus galaxy.
Figure 9 shows the spatial distribution in the sky of the 1,542
VVV NIRGC galaxies in the studied region. The background is
colour-coded by the AV interstellar extinction, and the Circinus
galaxy is represented by an ellipse, as shown in Figure 1. Galax-
ies with zphot < 0.04 are represented by red triangles of different
sizes depending on the half-light radius. The eight of these galax-
ies with R1/2 > 2.45 arcsec are shown with the biggest triangles
and they appear scattered across the field, without any clear over-
density or clustering near the Circinus position. However, these
sources are still significantly distant from the systemic redshift
of the Circinus galaxy (z ∼0.0015), and none of them can be
confidently associated with its immediate halo.
Galaxies with zphot > 0.04 are shown as grey circles in the
figure. These remaining galaxies are consistent with being back-
ground sources, and are likely to be part of the large-scale struc-
ture located behind the Galactic plane. Their spatial distribution
reflects both the intrinsic clustering of distant galaxies and the
impact of spatially varying interstellar extinction, which affects
the depth of detections across different regions of the field.
The VVV NIRGC galaxies reached 2 magnitudes deeper
than the 2MASS Extended Source Catalogue (2MASSX; Jarrett
2004), although we were unable to find Circinus satellites. In ad-
dition, the study of Stalevski et al. (2019) has revealed that the
mid-infrared dust emission from Circinus AGN appears promi-
nently extended in the polar direction. This result suggests that
the polar dust wind is indeed optically thick, significantly con-
tributing to the obscuration, which might explain the scarcity of
satellites in the Circinus neighbourhood.
6. Summary and final remarks
In this study, we searched for satellite galaxies within a circular
area of a 2-degree radius around the Circinus galaxy, the near-
est type-2 Seyfert galaxy. The radius of the studied region rep-
resents roughly 2/3 of the Circinus virial radius, and a total of
1,542 galaxies were selected from the VVV NIRGC I and VVV
NIRGC III catalogues, and visually inspected using J, H, and Ks
images of both the VVV and VVVX surveys. The limiting mag-
nitude was Ks = 15.5 mag, with a completeness of detections
of about 90%, corresponding to an absolute magnitude limit of
MKs = −12.6 mag. We identified 20 candidate satellites for the
Circinus galaxy that have a half-light radius in the range 2.45
< R1/2 < 5.46 arcsec, consistent with expected angular sizes for
dwarf satellites found in galaxies.
We implemented, for the first time, the photometric redshift
estimates in this extinct region of the sky due to the presence of
the Galactic disc using machine learning techniques applied to
NIR photometry. The ANNz algorithm was trained on a care-
fully selected subset of galaxies with known spectroscopic red-
shifts and photometry of both VVV and VVVX surveys. This
procedure enabled us to obtain reliable photometric redshifts,
particularly in the range 0.001 < zphot < 0.023, where the cal-
ibration was most effective. This range includes the Circinus
galaxy (z ∼0.0015), and we found eight low-redshift galaxies
(zphot < 0.04) with sizes of typical dwarf satellites of R1/2 > 2.45
arcsec, but far from the Circinus galaxy.
In the studied region, within a 2-degree radius around the
Circinus galaxy, a resolved satellite system around the galaxy
could not be verified using the current data. However, this does
not rule out the existence of faint dwarf satellites. Given the large
angular size, high surface brightness, and complex structure of
the Circinus galaxy itself, it is plausible that low-luminosity
satellites remain undetected because of projection effects, high

The methodology developed here constitutes a significant
step forward. The estimated uncertainties for zphot of around
∼0.005 ensured the effective removal of distant background
galaxies. This technique provides a foundation for more com-
plete future studies of low-redshift galaxies behind the Galactic
disc, and confirms that even challenging areas of the sky can be
incorporated into extragalactic science.
In regions of low Galactic latitudes, photometric redshift
techniques are essential because spectroscopic data are either
severely limited or absent. While less precise than spectroscopic
measurements, these estimates effectively exclude high-redshift
galaxies, thereby refining candidate galaxy samples. This ap-
proach is the most realistic and effective technique to overcome
the significant observational challenge in the zone of avoidance,
and will enable us to expand our understanding of the nearby
Universe. Spectroscopic follow-up observations are essential for
confirming galaxies and conducting precise dynamical studies.
When combined with the photometric methods presented herein,
this will substantially enhance our ability to map the distribu-
tion of galaxies, in general, and also the faint satellite systems
of nearby galaxies, in particular. This will improve our under-
standing of galaxy formation and evolution within the broader
cosmological context.
