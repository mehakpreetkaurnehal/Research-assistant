ABSTRACT
Supervised deep learning methods typically require large datasets and high-quality labels to achieve
reliable predictions. However, their performance often degrades when trained on imperfect labels.
To address this challenge, we propose a physics-aware loss function that serves as a penalty term to
mitigate label imperfections during training. In addition, we introduce a modified U-Net–Enhanced
Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) that achieves high-fidelity feature representation while leveraging
the advantages of operator learning in function space. By combining these two components, we
develop a physics-aware UFNO (PAUFNO) framework that effectively learns from imperfect labels.
To evaluate the proposed framework, we apply it to the denoising of distributed acoustic sensing
(DAS) data from the Utah FORGE site. The label data were generated using an integrated filtering-
based method, but still contain residual coupling noise in the near-wellbore channels. The denoising
workflow incorporates a patching-based data augmentation strategy, including an uplifting step,
spatial-domain convolutional operations, spectral convolution, and a projection layer to restore data
to the desired shape. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework
achieves superior denoising performance, effectively enhancing DAS records and recovering hidden
signals with high accuracy. Codes and data related to this work are fully open-sourced via https:

Introduction
Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is an emerging technique that enables the acquisition of ultra-high-density seismic
records, offering a cost-effective and high-resolution approach to seismic exploration. In seismology, DAS has been
successfully deployed in various applications, such as well logging, reservoir monitoring, CO2 storage monitoring,
and earthquake monitoring, positioning it as a viable alternative to conventional geophone-based approaches [Fichtner
et al., 2025]. Compared with traditional seismic acquisition methods, DAS offers several unique advantages, including

resistance to high temperatures and pressures, ultra–high channel density, and exceptional sensitivity. These features
allow DAS to deliver high-resolution seismic data even under extreme environmental conditions.
However, this very sensitivity also makes DAS particularly susceptible to noise, which complicates subsequent data
processing and interpretation. The noise manifests in diverse and complex forms, such as random noise, erratic noise,
horizontal noise, chessboard noise, fiber system noise, and zigzag noise, posing significant challenges to accurate
seismic imaging. Consequently, developing effective denoising strategies for DAS data remains a critical and ongoing
research priority. Over the past few decades, numerous denoising methods have been proposed for seismic data. These
approaches can be broadly categorized into mathematical model–driven techniques and deep learning (DL)–based,
data-driven methods [Mousavi and Beroza, 2022]. Despite their effectiveness, most existing techniques are designed
to suppress only a single type of noise (e.g., random noise, erratic noise, or surface waves) within seismic profiles,
limiting their applicability in real-world DAS scenarios. The ultra-dense nature of DAS records provides significant
advantages for DL-based processing, as deep learning excels at performing complex, nonlinear, high-order mappings
across massive datasets. In contrast, conventional filter-based methods are computationally inefficient and tend to
perform poorly when handling DAS records with strong coherent noise [Cui et al., 2025a].
Over the past decades, DL has drawn significant attention in the seismology community [Mousavi and Beroza,
2022], with models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Autoencoders (AEs), Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM), U-Net, Transformers, and Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs) typically serving as discriminative models,
while Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models represent the class of generative models.
Discriminative models have demonstrated high accuracy in seismic phase detection, reconstruction, and inversion by
effectively capturing complex nonlinear relationships between the training and target domains [Han et al., 2024, Cui
et al., 2025b]. However, they often show poor robustness when even training with large-scale domain-specific data. In
contrast, generative models excel at synthesizing realistic seismic records, facilitating denoising, super-resolution, and
inversion, though their training is often computationally demanding and may lack interpretability [Dou et al., 2023,
Durall et al., 2023]. Bearing the principles of discriminative and generative models in mind, we introduce Fourier
Neural Operators (FNOs) [Li et al., 2020, Wen et al., 2022], which have emerged as a promising paradigm in seismology.
Unlike conventional discriminative or generative approaches, FNOs learn mappings directly between function spaces,
enabling efficient modeling of wavefield propagation and other PDE-governed processes [Zhu et al., 2023a, Song
et al., 2024, Badawi and Gildin, 2025, Ma and Alkhalifah, 2025]. In the context of seismic denoising, this unique
property allows FNOs to capture global frequency-domain features for effective suppression of diverse and complex
noise types, while simultaneously preserving the physical consistency of seismic wavefields. Xie et al. [2025] proposed
a physics-informed neural network to suppress terratic and random noise, which is highlighted by embedding physics
information for seismic denoising. As a result, FNOs provide superior generalization to unseen scenarios and offer
a robust, computationally efficient, and physically grounded framework for seismic data processing, particularly for
challenging DAS denoising tasks.

Related work
In practice, processing techniques developed for geophone-based seismic data are often applied to DAS acquisitions.
Nevertheless, the unique characteristics of DAS pose challenges for model-specific denoising. For instance, Lellouch
et al. [2021] employed both low-pass and median filters to suppress strong noise in DAS records. Additionally, trace
editing is commonly applied to handle severely noisy traces. To mitigate these issues, Chen et al. [2023] proposed
the integrated denoising framework (IDF), a method that integrates multiple filters to suppress various types of noise.
Specifically, the bandpass filter removes high-frequency noise, the structure-oriented median filter further suppresses
high-amplitude erratic noise, and the dip filter in the f −k domain attenuates regular vertical and horizontal noise.
However, the high computational cost of IDF limits its applicability to large-scale datasets. Oboué et al. [2024] enhanced
the structure-oriented median filter through a spatially varying scheme and introduced a local orthogonalization (LO)
approach to suppress strong noise while preserving weak signals, which shows robust denoising performance across
different tests from the Utah FORGE site [Martin and Nash, 2019].
DL is characterized by learning a non-linear mapping from massive data, which makes it well-suited for processing
DAS records. Recently, numerous DAS denoisers based on both supervised learning (SL) and unsupervised learning
(USL) methods have been developed. Van den Ende et al. [2021] proposed a self-supervised learning method for
denoising DAS data with complex noise, while Dong et al. [2022] introduced a multiscale spatial attention network
to eliminate background noise, enhancing the detection of subtle signals by prioritizing local feature extraction in
DAS data. Similarly, Wu et al. [2022] developed a multiscale denoising framework utilizing convolutional operations
across various data dimensions. Zhong et al. [2023] presented a multiscale encoder-decoder network aimed at both
background noise suppression and weak signal recovery. Yang et al. [2023a] proposed a fully convolutional framework
to extract hidden signals and attenuate diverse noise types in DAS data. Yang et al. [2023b] also introduced SLKNet,
2

an SL method for DAS-VSP noise suppression, leveraging a dense-connection network with a kernel-wise attention
mechanism. Zhu et al. [2023b] developed a diffusion model to mitigate strongly coupled noise in DAS-VSP data,
generating training data using the wave equation to simulate noise-free labels and an existing algorithm [Yu et al.,
2018] to produce coupling noise. Building on the work of Zhu et al. [2023b], Xu et al. [2024a] trained a U-net model
to suppress strong “zigzag” noise, although they relied exclusively on synthetic data for training. Birnie and Ravasi
[2024] employed a blind-mask self-supervised network to denoise various types of coherent noise in seismic profiles.
Despite the notable success of these approaches in both geophone and DAS data denoising, developing a robust,
generalizable unsupervised method capable of handling diverse and unseen data remains an ongoing challenge. Based
on our investigations, there are very few publications that utilize operator learning for seismic data denoising tasks,
especially for DAS. Therefore, we aim to explore its potential for suppressing diverse types of noise in DAS data as a
case study.
Many researchers have investigated DAS denoising using open-source data from the Utah FORGE site [Yang et al.,
2023a,b, Saad et al., 2024, Xu et al., 2024b, Cui et al., 2025a]. However, none of these studies have addressed the
presence of coupling noise in near-wellbore channels. The existence of coupling noise in the near-wellbore channels
(see Figure 9) can adversely affect subsequent data-processing steps, such as arrival-time picking and microseismic
event localization. Therefore, developing an approach capable of further suppressing the residual noise in the label data
is of critical importance. To address this issue, we propose a U-Net–enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) that
integrates a physics-aware loss function to effectively attenuate strong noise in DAS recordings (see Figure 1). PAUFNO
combines the advantages of operator learning and physics-informed neural networks, enabling it to significantly
outperform conventional model-driven approaches and the U-Net baseline. Unlike CNNs or U-Nets that learn finite-
domain mappings, the FNO learns an operator between function spaces, allowing inference at resolutions different
from those used during training. We employ a patching strategy [Chen, 2020] to extract 2D training patch pairs from
the Utah FORGE field dataset. Although the model is trained on imperfect labels containing residual coupling noise,
the incorporation of the physics-aware loss function mitigates the influence of these imperfections. Once trained,
the learned operator can generalize to various input types and resolutions using the workflow illustrated in Figure 2,
without the need for retraining. Numerical experiments further confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
denoising framework.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We first introduce the principles of the proposed PAUFNO
framework and its corresponding DAS denoising workflow. Next, we present a comparative evaluation of denoising
performance between PAUFNO and several benchmark approaches on field datasets collected from different surveys.
We then discuss the model’s generalization capability, uncertainty quantification, and limitations. Finally, we summarize
the proposed DAS denoising strategy, which effectively mitigates coupling noise arising from imperfect fiber–well
coupling by incorporating physics-aware loss function.

Methodology
This section first introduces the problem formulation for DAS denoising, followed by the diagram and operational
principles of the proposed neural operator (NO)–based denoising framework. Finally, we present the physics-aware loss
function designed to enhance coupling-noise suppression.
2.1
Problem setup
During the data acquisition process, sensors such as geophones and fiber-optic cables inevitably capture both signal and
noise. Furthermore, due to the high sensitivity of DAS cables, they are particularly prone to recording additional noise
sources, including fiber system noise, coupling noise arising from poor contact between the DAS fiber and the wellbore
wall or ground surface, and ambient noise. The acquired DAS records can be mathematically formulated as:
Y = S + N + r,
(1)
where Y denotes the recorded DAS data, S the desired signal component, N the noise component, and r the residual
noise. The goal of denoising is to recover the underlying signal S from the field data Y while effectively suppressing
the variable noise N. In supervised deep learning, large amounts of labeled data are required for training. However,
obtaining accurate ground-truth labels for field data is inherently challenging, which often leads to residual noise r
that remains difficult to eliminate completely. The spectral energy distribution differences of signal and coupling noise
provide the basis for designing the FK masks in the next sections.

Figure 1: Diagram of the proposed DAS denoising framework. The model begins with an uplifting layer (P) that
projects the input features into a higher-dimensional space. The resulting feature maps are then processed in parallel
by the UFNO and FNO blocks, followed by an efficient channel attention (ECA) module that captures fine-grained
information in both the spatial and frequency domains. Unlike the standard FNO block, the UFNO branch includes an
additional U-Net channel to enhance feature representation in the time domain. Finally, a projection layer (Q) maps the
high-dimensional features back to the input dimensionality to produce the denoised output. The symbol σ denotes the
activation function.
Figure 2: Inference workflow of the trained operator. The input noisy records are first divided into overlapping patches
with fixed dimensions. These noisy patches are then processed by the trained operator to perform denoising. After
obtaining the denoised patches, an inverse patching scheme is applied to reconstruct the full denoised output. It is worth
noting that the trained operator can effectively handle patches with resolutions different from those used during training,
as it learns underlying functional relationships rather than fixed nonlinear mappings within finite domains.

Network principle
The proposed network builds on the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) [Li et al., 2020], which learns nonlinear mappings
between infinite-dimensional function spaces and has proven effective for solving partial differential equations (PDEs).
In this work, we repurpose this operator-learning paradigm for DAS denoising, a non-PDE setting, to explore the
broader applicability of neural operators (NOs).
As shown in Figure 1, the architecture comprises an input uplifting layer P, a stack of FNO and U-FNO blocks
augmented with Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) [Wang et al., 2020], and an output projection layer Q. The
lifting layer P expands the feature dimensionality from 1 channel to width, enhancing representational capacity. The
subsequent operator blocks extract complementary information by combining global spectral modeling (via truncated
Fourier transforms) with local convolutional pathways; in U-FNO blocks, a U -Net branch further refines locality while
ECA adaptively reweights channels to emphasize informative responses. Finally, the projection layer Q maps the
features from the lifted space back to the input dimensionality, yielding a denoised estimate with the same spatial
resolution as the input.
2.3
Physics-aware loss function
In the context of DAS denoising, where fiber-optic coupling artifacts often manifest as high-energy noise in specific
low-velocity cones within the frequency-wavenumber (FK) domain. The residual high-energy coupled noise is hard
to suppress, as indicated by Chen et al. [2023]. Furthermore, prior research trained on label data generated by the
integrated filters proposes that a hybrid supervised loss function is employed to balance data fidelity with physics-aware
constraints.
This approach leverages the dual-triangular penalty mask (shown in Figure 3a) to suppress noise in targeted FK regions
while preserving seismic signal integrity. Specifically, let x ∈RB×C×H×W denote the predicted denoised time-distance
data, y ∈RB×C×H×W the target labels with residual coupling noise, M ∈RH×W the precomputed triangular penalty
mask. Figure 3a exhibits the proposed dual-triangle masks, where we keep the values inside as 1 and outside as 0. The
size of the dual-triangle mask is designed by the energy distribution of coupling noise in FK spectra. By analyzing the
residual coupled noise and the signal’s FK spectrum, we ultimately selected a dual-triangular mask. As illustrated in
Figure 3a, the vertices of the two triangles are positioned at the zero-wavenumber point. The short-side vertex angle α
is set to 35◦, and the leg adjacent to this 35◦angle has a length of 40 sample points. The shape of the triangular mask
is designed according to the energy distribution of the noise. Our goal is to cover the noise energy region as fully as
possible while minimizing contamination of the signal energy. Moreover, we discussed the selection of the short-side
vertex angle α in the “DISCUSSION” section.
As shown in Figure 3b, s denotes the current training step, sw the number of warmup steps (set to 200 by default,
consistent with the number of epochs), and 1 −λ represents the hyperparameter that balances the FK term. In the
hybrid loss function (Equation 6), we set λ = 0.98. This warmup scheme for the FK loss introduces a soft energy
cutoff, thereby preventing signal degradation in the initial training phase.
The FK dual-triangle loss, LFK(x, s), penalizes excessive energy within these noise-prone triangular regions of the FK
spectrum, formulated as
LF K(x, s) = w(s) ·

where F(·) represents the centered 2D fast Fourier transform defined by Equation 3 (unnormalized, with zero frequency
centered), |·| is the complex modulus. Similar to the implementation in DASCore [Chambers et al., 2024], we computed
the FK spectra as follows:
F(xb,c) = fftshift(fft2(xb,c)),
(3)
The cosine annealing warmup schedule (shown in Figure 3b) is implemented that gradually ramps the penalty from 0 to
0.5 over sw steps, thereby avoiding premature over-constraint (causing signal damage) during the early training stage:

The FK loss proposed by Equations 2 to 4 is to mitigate the remaining noise in labels caused by the poor coupling
between the fiber optics and wellbore. Therefore, it acts as a correction term in the training loop. However, to maintain
the correct parts in labels and enforce the pixel-wise reconstruction accuracy, we need to employ the supervised loss

Therefore, we get the total hybrid loss, Ltotal(x, y, s), integrates these components via a weighted sum:
L = λ · LL1(x, y) + (1 −λ) · LF K(x, s)
(6)
which simultaneously minimizes reconstruction discrepancies and attenuates noise energy in the FK cones, enhancing
DAS data quality by mitigating coupling-induced artifacts without distorting valid wavefields.

Uncertainty quantification
MC Dropout has been widely recognized as an effective approach for quantifying uncertainty in deep learning models,
particularly when assessing the confidence of model predictions. In this study, we employ the MC Dropout technique to
evaluate the denoising confidence of the PAUFNO model, with a specific focus on the near-wellbore region (channels
0–50), where the loss term enforces correction.
The model incorporates dropout layers within the convolutional and U-Net components, which are reactivated during
inference to generate a set of stochastic predictions. Specifically, for each input sample x, the model produces T

Results
In this section, we introduce the operator inference results, comparing the results of trained operators with those of
the IDF [Chen et al., 2023] method. Moreover, we will introduce the out-of-distribution training data to validate the
generalizability of the trained physics-aware neural operator.
3.1
Training data generation
The fiber-optic cable was installed in a borehole configuration to serve as a dense receiver array in the monitoring well
78-32. The data were recorded with a sampling interval of 0.5 ms, a channel spacing of 1 m, and a gauge length of 10 m.
All labels were generated using the integrated, filter-based denoising method proposed by Chen et al. [2023]. After data
augmentation, this process yielded 1,152 training pairs and 128 validation pairs, each of size 128 × 128. To ensure
reproducibility, we provide all hyperparameters used in training in Table 1. Moreover, to provide a comprehensive
comparison, we trained the proposed UFNO in a data-driven manner together with baseline U-Net [Ronneberger
et al., 2015] to benchmark PAUFNO. All hyperparameters, i.e., learning rate, patch size, number of training samples,
and epochs, were kept identical across models to ensure a fair comparison. All experiments were conducted on a
workstation equipped with an NVIDIA RTX A4500 GPU. In addition, we compare PAUFNO with IDF to demonstrate
its effectiveness relative to an integrated filtering-based approach. Table 2 summarizes the training time, number of
trainable parameters, and inference time for a single example (with a spatial dimension of 2000×960 samples) from the
Utah FORGE site. It is evident that PAUFNO and UFNO contain fewer trainable parameters than the U-Net. However,
both models require longer training and inference times than the U-Net due to their feature representations in the Fourier
domain are time-consuming.

As shown in Figure 4, all denoising approaches performed remarkably in terms of signal preservation and noise
suppression. However, with the addition of the FK loss term, PAUFNO achieves superior performance in reducing
residual noise caused by poor coupling between the fiber-optic cable and the wellbore. In particular, as shown in
Figure 5, channels 0–50 demonstrate that incorporating the physics-aware loss function further suppresses coupling
noise, even when the model is trained with imperfect labels. The zoomed-in sections in Figure 5 correspond to

regions containing only residual noise, both signal and coupled noise, and purely signal, respectively. These results
clearly indicate that the physics-aware UFNO not only effectively recovers the underlying signals but also attenuates
the coupled noise. To provide a more detailed comparison, the corresponding FK spectra of Figure 4 are presented
in Figure 6, which further highlights the effectiveness of the proposed dual-triangle penalty in the FK domain. As
shown in Figures 6b and 6c, the proposed model markedly suppresses energy concentrated in the low-frequency and
small-wavenumber regions (highlighted by red arrows), consistent with the removal of coupling noise observed in
Figure 4c.
The second example (see Figure 7a), characterized by strong residual coupling noise and the absence of visible seismic
events, is introduced to evaluate whether the denoising approaches generate artifacts when no hidden signal is present.
The label data (Figure 7b) clearly exhibits persistent coupling noise, which leads to the failure of both the U-Net and
data-driven UFNO in effectively removing it. In contrast, the PAUFNO significantly attenuates the residual coupling
noise remaining in the label, demonstrating superior generalization and robustness under poor coupling conditions.
As shown in Figures 8a–8e, the residual coupling noise exhibits spectral energy concentrated in the low-frequency
and low-wavenumber regions, forming a trend from the upper right to the lower left. Moreover, the spectra shown in
Figure 8 further suggest that physics-aware UFNO achieves promising residual coupling noise suppression performance.
Figure 9a illustrates the DAS record of the poor coupling between the fiber-optical cable and wellbore condition,
which requires specialized processing to mitigate. Compared with Figures 9b, 9d, and 9e, Figure 9c demonstrates that
PAUFNO more effectively removes coupling noise while preserving useful signal components. The corresponding FK
spectra (Figure 10) further confirm this result, showing that PAUFNO attenuates low-frequency and small-wavenumber
energy with opposite dips to the hidden signals. In contrast to UFNO and U-Net, PAUFNO selectively reduces energy
in the low-frequency and small-wavenumber regions (highlighted by red arrows) while retaining the spectral energy of
the seismic signals.
3.3
Generalization test
We demonstrated the denoising performance of different methods on DAS recordings from the Utah FORGE site.
Typically, for deep learning models trained in a supervised manner, it is necessary to retrain the network or apply
transfer learning to achieve satisfactory performance on previously unseen data. To further assess their generalization
and robustness, we conducted additional experiments on DAS data acquired from different field surveys. All models
were trained exclusively on the Utah FORGE dataset and then applied to unseen data without any retraining. The unseen
data were obtained from a 3D DAS-VSP survey conducted at the geothermal in-situ laboratory in Groß Schönebeck,
Germany [Martuganova et al., 2022]. The DAS measurements at this site were recorded with a temporal sampling
interval of 2 ms and a spatial sampling interval of 5 m along the entire well.

Figure 11: Out-of-distribution test on seismic data from the Groß Sch"onebeck site. (a) shows the raw input data. (b–d)
present the denoised results obtained using PAUFNO, UFNO, and U-Net, respectively. (e–g) display the corresponding
removed noise sections produced by each model. (h–j) illustrate the local similarity maps computed between the
denoised data and the removed noise for PAUFNO, UFNO, and U-Net, respectively. Note that we provide the mean
values of each similarity map, which indicates PAUFNO causes the least signal damage.
Figure 11 presents the out-of-distribution test conducted on data recorded from a different survey. Compared to the
Utah FORGE dataset, this dataset contains a new type of “zigzag” noise that was not observed in the training data,
posing additional challenges for conventional deep learning models. To further evaluate denoising performance, we
employ local similarity [Chen and Fomel, 2015], which measures the orthogonality between the denoised signal and the
removed noise. Higher local similarity values indicate greater signal leakage (i.e., more signal damage), whereas lower
values reflect better signal preservation. Because of the dip differences between the seismic events at the Utah FORGE
site and those at the Groß Schönebeck site, the data array was flipped horizontally when applying the PAUFNO method.
As shown in Figures 11b–11d, all methods effectively suppress the strong random noise. However, the PAUFNO
predictions exhibit greater spatial consistency, particularly around the regions highlighted by the green arrows in
Figure 11. In contrast, the UFNO and U-Net results show more signal distortion in their corresponding removed-noise
sections. The local similarity maps in Figures 11h–j further confirm that PAUFNO demonstrates higher robustness and
better signal preservation than the benchmark methods.

Discussion
The results demonstrate a performance comparison across experiments for various methods and provide evidence that
PAUFNO can effectively enhance weak seismic signals in DAS recordings, even when trained with imperfect labels.
Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of PAUFNO is necessary, particularly regarding its uncertainty and inherent
limitations. Therefore, in this section, we introduce Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout [Gal and Ghahramani, 2016] within the
proposed NOs-based framework to quantify model uncertainty and further investigate the limitations of PAUFNO.
4.1
Uncertainty quantification
To perform UQ experiments, we conduct T = 30 stochastic forward passes for each input patch to estimate the
predictive distribution. The MC dropout probability is set to 0.2 for both models. We specifically focus our analysis on
the near-wellbore traces, where the physics-aware loss is designed to correct label imperfections.
Figure 12 presents the MC Dropout–based UQ results for PAUFNO and UFNO. The yellow contour masks in Figures
12b and 12e highlight the top 5% highest uncertainty regions. These contours indicate that PAUFNO exhibits higher
confidence around the near-wellbore area, suggesting that the physics-aware loss effectively suppresses residual coupling
noise in the label data. Furthermore, Figures 12d and 12g show the STD maps deracross experiments for various
methods and provide evidence that PAUFNO can effectively enhance weak seismic signals in DAS recordings,an UFNO
within channels 1–50. However, in the near-offset region, PAUFNO displays slightly higher uncertainty than UFNO,
which may stem from the physics-aware loss enforcing imperfect labels too directly during training. Overall, the UQ
experiments demonstrate that the proposed PAUFNO exhibits a strong robustness across the uncertainty test.

FORGE site showing strong residual coupling noise. (b) The first 128 channels of the label and predicted data obtained

dominated by residual noise. (c) Normalized mean-squared error (MSE) between the label and predictions in (b) as a
function of α, with each value normalized by the maximum MSE for consistent comparison.
4.2
Mask size determination
The physics-aware loss with the dual-triangle mask constitutes the principal novelty of this work. Consequently,
investigating how to design the mask’s geometry – specifically its size and shape is essential. We conducted extensive
experiments to evaluate the influence of the short-side vertex angle, α, on denoising performance, focusing on the first
128 channels. Figure 13 illustrates the procedure for selecting the short-side vertex angle. A representative example
was chosen in which no clear seismic events are visible; however, strong residual coupling noise remains, particularly
within channels 0–100. Since the physics-aware loss term is designed to suppress this residual noise, analyzing the
difference between the label and the model predictions provides valuable guidance for selecting an appropriate mask
configuration, namely the choice of α.
In this analysis, the leg adjacent to α was fixed at a length of 40 sample points, which is sufficient to encompass the
majority of the residual noise energy in the FK domain. The mean squared error (MSE) is computed as:
MSE = 1
N
N
X
n=1
( ˆyi −yi)2,
(9)
where N = 128 × 2000 denotes the total number of sample points, ˆy represents the predictions obtained from models
trained with different α values, and y is the corresponding label data.
Figures 13b and 13c present the predicted results and the normalized MSE curve for vertex angles ranging from 10◦
to 60◦. The results indicate that α = 35◦achieves satisfactory denoising performance; increasing α further begins to
affect the signal energy adversely. Therefore, we ultimately selected the dual-triangle masks sharing a common vertex,
with the vertex angle 35◦, and the leg adjacent to this angle, forming the right angle, has a length of 40 sample points.
4.3
Limitation and future work
In the sections above, we have already demonstrated the power of the proposed UFNO and physics-aware loss function
across variable experiments. However, it is necessary to point out the limitations of the proposed method to gain a
deeper understanding of the proposed method, as well as provide guidance for future work.
• Patch boundary artifacts. Compared with the purely data-driven UFNO model, PAUFNO faces challenges
in handling predictions at the patch boundaries. During inference, we applied an overlap of 18 samples
between adjacent patches to alleviate this issue. However, reducing the overlap leads to more noticeable
“white boundary” artifacts, which can be addressed by conducting the second inference with shifted patching.

Alternatively, we could only focus on the part with residual noise in which usually appears around the
near-wellbore channels.
• Designing triangle masks. In this work, we employed a triangular mask with a short-side vertex angle of 30°
and a leg length corresponding to 40 sample points. In future research, it would be worthwhile to investigate
an adaptive mask design strategy potentially guided by the spatial energy distribution or signal-to-noise ratio
to further improve the model’s physical consistency and generalization capability.
• To improve the imperfect labels, a physics-aware loss function is introduced to correct residual noise using
appropriate masks in the FK domain. This approach allows us to focus specifically on regions containing
residual noise. Once these areas are corrected, we can train another deep learning model in a purely data-driven
manner, thereby mitigating the impact of imperfect labels.

Conclusions
Recovering weak signals obscured by complex noise in DAS data remains a long-standing challenge. Conventional
denoising methods often struggle to balance effective noise suppression with artifact mitigation. In this work, we
proposed a new framework that incorporates a physics-aware loss function as a penalty term to correct the imperfect
labels generated by filter-based approaches. In addition, a patch-based neural operator is introduced to enable high-
accuracy feature representation in both the time and frequency domains. The synergy between the physics-aware
loss function and operator learning establishes a novel paradigm for training with imperfect labels while achieving
outstanding denoising performance. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the data-driven UFNO outperforms the
U-Net, exhibiting greater flexibility in handling varying input sizes without retraining. Furthermore, by leveraging the
physics-aware loss, the UFNO effectively suppresses residual coupling noise in near-wellbore channels, highlighting
the robustness and accuracy of the proposed physics-informed neural operator–based denoising framework.
This work may inspire future research in areas such as wavefield separation and other types of noise suppression, where
signal and noise can be disentangled within specific transform domains (e.g., FK, Radon, or wavelet domains). In
addition, incorporating the physics-aware loss term does not require the inverse of any transform, thereby mitigating
artifacts and errors that typically arise during inverse transforms.
