Abstract: We present a supervised machine learning classification of sources from the
Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS) Pathfinder
datasets: miniJPAS and J-NEP. Leveraging crossmatches with spectroscopic and photo-
metric catalogs, we construct a robust labeled dataset comprising 14 594 sources classified
into extended (galaxies) and point-like (stars and quasars) objects. We assess dataset repre-
sentativeness using UMAP analysis, confirming broad and consistent coverage of feature
space. An XGBoost classifier, with hyperparameters tuned using automated optimization,
is trained using purely photometric data (60-band J-PAS magnitudes) and combined photo-
metric and morphological features, with performance thoroughly evaluated via ROC and
purity–completeness metrics. Incorporating morphology significantly improves classification,
outperforming the baseline classifications available in the catalogs. Permutation importance
analysis reveals morphological parameters, particularly concentration, normalized peak
surface brightness, and PSF, alongside photometric features around 4000 and 6900 Å, as
crucial for accurate classifications. We release a value-added catalog with our models for

cosmological and astrophysical analyses.

1. Introduction
The Javalambre Physics of the Accelerating Universe Astrophysical Survey1 (J-PAS) is
a ground-based imaging survey that will map thousands of square degrees using a unique
set of 56 filters, providing a low-resolution spectrum for every pixel of the sky (R ∼60),2
without the target selection biases or fiber collision issues that typically affect spectroscopic
surveys. Designed and optimized to achieve highly accurate photometric redshifts, its
scientific objectives span from cosmology to galaxy evolution [1].
Here we focus on data from the Pathfinder camera, which was used to test the telescope
performance and execute the first scientific operations. The camera features a 9k ×9k CCD,
with a 0.3deg2 field of view and 0.225 arcsec pixel size. This effort led to the miniJPAS
[1] and J-NEP [2] surveys, which covered 1 deg2 of the AEGIS field (four pointings around
(RA, Dec) = (215◦, 53◦)) and 0.29 deg2 of the North Ecliptic Pole (one pointing centred at
(RA, Dec) = (260.6◦, 65.8◦)), respectively. Both surveys use the 56 J-PAS filters together
with the u, g, r, and i broad bands3, for a total of 60 bands. However, J-NEP adopted
longer exposure times, reaching between 0.5–1.0 magnitudes deeper than miniJPAS, which
itself reaches the target depth of J-PAS–namely, mAB ≈24 in the broad-band filters (5σ in
a 3” aperture).4
While miniJPAS targeted the well-studied Extended Groth Strip field, an area observed
by many experiments, J-NEP fully covers the time-domain field of the James Webb Space
Telescope’s North Ecliptic Pole [3], a region chosen for its low galactic extinction, absence
of bright stars, and continuous visibility from Webb’s northern hemisphere.
Our main goal here is to provide a machine learning-based classification of J-NEP
sources as an alternative to the Bayesian stellar and galactic loci classifier (SGLC [4],
in jnep.StarGalClass5). This aims both to validate the quality of the SGLC, possibly
outperfoming it, and to offer an independent classification that can be used to assess the
robustness of subsequent scientific analyses. In particular, our approach incorporates the
full photometric information, which is crucial for faint galaxies whose morphology closely
resembles that of stars.
The SGLC is based on morphological information, specifically on the bimodal distri-
bution observed in the concentration–magnitude diagram, which distinguishes compact
point-like objects from extended sources. López-Sanjuan et al. [4] modeled these two popu-
lations to compute the probability that a given source is compact or extended. This model,
combined with appropriate priors, was then used to estimate the Bayesian probability that
a source is a star or a galaxy [1].
In Baqui et al. [5], we obtained the machine learning classification of miniJPAS sources,
available in minijpas.StarGalClass. Here, taking advantage of new spectroscopic data

The wavelength resolution Rλ is defined as Rλ = λ/∆λ, so that R ∼60 is the approximate value in the
intermediate wavelength range in the J-PAS filter system.

The J-PAS survey itself employs only the i broad band in addition to the 56 narrow bands.

and an improved methodology, we revise the classification of miniJPAS sources and provide
a machine learning classification of J-NEP sources. This paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes the training data, Section 3 presents the feature configuration, Section 4
details the classification methodology and examines the representativeness of the labeled
set, and Section 5 reports the results. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 6.
2. Data
In this work, we primarily used the jnep.MagABDualObj and minijpas.MagABDualObj
tables from the data releases J-NEP-PDR202107 and MINIJ-PAS-PDR201912, respectively,
available at j-pas.org/datareleases. These catalogs provide photometric and morphological
measurements for all sources detected in the r band, with forced photometry in the remaining
filters. The r band was adopted as the detection image owing to its depth, image quality,
and completeness, as detailed in Bonoli et al. [1]. All queries employed in this work are
listed in Appendix A.
To ensure data quality, we required objects to satisfy mask_flags=0, which excludes
detections affected by image boundaries, bright-star halos, or artifacts. For the flags field,
which encodes issues encountered during photometric extraction, we retained objects with
values 0 (clean, no problems detected), 1 (neighbor, the object is close to bright neighbors
or contains bad pixels), 2 (blended, originally detected together with another source but
successfully deblended), 4 (saturated, containing one or more pixels at or near saturation),
and 6 (blended + saturated, a combination of the previous two cases). These situations can
still yield reliable photometry and remain relevant for galaxy and cluster science, whereas
more severe conditions (e.g., truncation at image edges, incomplete aperture measurements,
or failed deblending) were excluded. This yields a total of 25,198 objects for miniJPAS and
7,290 objects for J-NEP within the range 15 < r < 23.5.
Since training supervised machine learning models requires ground-truth labels, we
cross-match miniJPAS and J-NEP data with surveys that provide reliable photometric
or spectroscopic classifications into extended (galaxies) and point-like (stars and quasars)
sources. This is a crucial step, as the performance of a supervised ML model depends
critically on the quality and representativeness of the adopted training set. The surveys
used for crossmatching in this work are:
•
SDSS DR12 (Section 2.1): the final Data Release (DR12) of the third-generation
Sloan Digital Sky Survey [SDSS-III, 6], which collected imaging and spectroscopy from
2008 to 2014, providing wide-area multiband photometry and spectra of millions of
sources.
•
Gaia EDR3 (Section 2.2): the Early Data Release 3 of the Gaia mission [7], delivering
high-precision astrometry, broad-band photometry, and radial velocities for over 1.5
billion stars in the Milky Way.
•
DEEP3 DR4 (Section 2.3): spectroscopic redshift survey conducted with DEIMOS
on the Keck II telescope in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) [8]. It provides secure
galaxy redshifts and spectra, forming part of the AEGIS survey program.
•
Binospec (Section 2.4): spectroscopic data from Binospec [9], a high-throughput
optical spectrograph on the 6.5-m MMT, covering 370–1000 nm with wide field of
view, used to obtain redshifts for faint galaxies.
•
DESI DR1 (Section 2.5): the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument [10], based on the first 13 months of the main survey. It provides high-
confidence redshifts for 18.7 million objects (13.1M galaxies, 1.6M quasars, 4.0M stars)
over more than 9000 deg2, making it the largest extragalactic spectroscopic sample to
date and a key resource for cosmology and large-scale structure studies.

•
HSC-SSP PDR2 (Section 2.6): the second public data release of the Hyper Suprime-
Cam Subaru Strategic Program [HSC-SSP, 11], providing deep, wide-field imaging in
five broad bands (grizy), with exquisite seeing from the Subaru telescope.
2.1. Crossmatch with SDSS DR12
We used the table minijpas.xmatch_sdss_dr12, which contains the crossmatch with
SDSS DR12 and includes both the photometric classification class, expected to be reliable
for 15 < r < 20 [5]6, and the spectroscopic classification spCl. The photometric classification
yields 802 galaxies and 1228 stars within 15 < r < 20, for a total of 2030 labeled sources.
The spectroscopic classification provides 355 galaxies and 220 point-like sources (94 stars
and 124 quasars) for r < 23.5, for a total of 573 labeled sources.
We also used the analogous table jnep.xmatch_sdss_dr12. The photometric classi-
fication yields 156 galaxies and 724 stars within 15 < r < 20, for a total of 880 labeled
sources. No spectroscopic labels were available, since J-NEP lies outside the SDSS footprint.
2.2. Crossmatch with Gaia EDR3
We used the tables minijpas.xmatch_gaia_edr3 and jnep.xmatch_gaia_edr3, which
contain the crossmatches with Gaia EDR37. Stars were identified as objects with a parallax
measured at a significance greater than 3σ, i.e., parallax_over_error > 3. This selection
yields 989 stars for miniJPAS and 570 stars for J-NEP.
2.3. Crossmatch between miniJPAS and DEEP3 DR4
We crossmatched miniJPAS with r < 23.5 with the DEEP3 DR4 catalog alldeep.egs.
2012jun13.8 In the case of duplicates, we retained the entry with the highest ZQUALITY,
and, if necessary, the one with the smallest redshift error Z_ERR. The crossmatch was
performed using the Python module onexmatch9 [12], adopting a maximum separation of 1
arcsec and an ambiguity threshold of 0.5 arcsec, yielding 8279 matched objects as shown in
Figure 1.
6
We verified this by comparing DESI, DEEP3, SDSS (spectroscopic), and Gaia sources (taken as ground
truth) against the SDSS photometric classification.

As we are interested in parallax, Gaia EDR3 is essentially equivalent to the newer Gaia DR3.

Figure 2. Crossmatch between Binospec and J-NEP sources with r < 23.5.
As shown by the diagnostic metrics, the positional offsets in Right Ascension and Dec-
lination are well described by a zero-mean isotropic 2D Gaussian whose standard deviation
is equal to the average of the measured σ∆RA and σ∆DEC; the resulting Kullback–Leibler
divergence is ≲0.1. The adoption of an ambiguity threshold of 0.5 arcsec removed 10
ambiguous DEEP3 matches associated with duplicated miniJPAS sources, whose positional
differences were below this threshold—about twice the pixel scale and comparable to the
PSF size. See Appendix C for more details.
After crossmatching, we retained only sources with ZQUALITY>=3, yielding 6583 galaxies,
433 active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and 5 stars. Unlike quasars (QSOs), many AGNs exhibit
extended morphologies, which introduces ambiguity in the classification process. To mitigate
this, we restricted point-like sources to objects with morph_prob_star>0.9 and redshift
Z>0.1, and stars to those with morph_prob_star>0.9 and Z<0.01. The morph_prob_star
values are provided by the jnep.StarGalClass table, which estimates stellar probability
from morphological information [4]. This selection resulted in 36 point-like sources (35
AGNs and 1 star). This filtering step was necessary to construct a clean labeled dataset.
Our study focuses on a binary star-galaxy classification, rather than a three-class star-
AGN/QSO-galaxy scheme, which would require a significantly larger and more balanced
AGN sample.
2.4. Crossmatch between J-NEP and Binospec data
We crossmatched J-NEP sources with r < 23.5 with data that was obtained by
Christopher Willmer using Binospec at the MMT observatory. Details about the dataset are
provided in Hernán-Caballero et al. [2]. The crossmatch was performed using the onexmatch
code, adopting a maximum separation of 1 arcsec and an ambiguity threshold of 0.5 arcsec,
and yielded 957 matched sources, as shown in Figure 2. The adoption of an ambiguity
threshold of 0.5 arcsec removed 67 ambiguous Binospec matches associated with duplicated
miniJPAS sources, mostly with positional differences below 0.2 arcsec (Figure C1).
After crossmatching, we retained only the 726 objects with ZQUALITY>=3 and Z_ERR<0.
01. Since the Binospec catalog does not provide spectroscopic classifications, we assigned
class labels based on morphology and redshift: objects with morph_prob_star > 0.9 and
Z < 0.01 were classified as stars, and those with morph_prob_star < 0.1 and Z > 0.01 as
galaxies. This yielded 53 stars and 593 galaxies, for a total of 646 objects. There are 69
objects with morph_prob_star > 0.1 and Z > 0.01. These could correspond either to QSOs
or to compact galaxies; we exclude this small set of sources from the catalog.

2.5. Crossmatch between miniJPAS and DESI DR1
We crossmatched miniJPAS sources with r < 23.5 with the DESI DR1 catalog.10 The
crossmatch was performed using the onexmatch code, adopting a maximum separation of
1 arcsec and an ambiguity threshold of 0.5 arcsec, and yielded 2865 matches, as shown in
Figure 3. The adoption of an ambiguity threshold of 0.5 arcsec removed 1232 ambiguous DESI
matches associated with duplicated miniJPAS sources, mostly with positional differences
below 0.05 arcsec (Figure C1).
After crossmatching, as suggested in [10], only sources with ZCAT_PRIMARY=True,
ZWARN=0 and DELTACHI2>25 were retained, for a total of 2640 objects. Of these, 2307 are
galaxies and 333 are point-like sources (124 QSOs and 209 stars).
2.6. Crossmatch between miniJPAS and HSC-SSP PDR2
We used the photometric classification provided by x_extendedness_value (with x=g,
r,i,z,y) from the catalog minijpas.xmatch_subaru_pdr2, which contains the crossmatch
with the HSC-SSP PDR2 catalog. To ensure consistency, we retained only the 11 960 objects
for which all five x_extendedness_value measurements agree.
We tested the HSC-SSP classification in the range 18.5 < r < 23.5 against DESI,
DEEP3, SDSS (spectroscopic) and Gaia sources, used as ground truth; see Table 1. We
find that for r > 22.5 a non-negligible fraction of stars, though small in absolute numbers,
are misclassified as galaxies. To minimize this effect, we restrict the HSC-SSP labels to the
range 18.5 < r < 22.5, where the bright limit avoids saturation. This selection yields 4406
galaxies and 946 stars, for a total of 5352 objects.

2.7. Final labeled set
The crossmatched catalogs from the previous sections partially overlap. When dealing
with duplicate J-PAS sources, we assigned class labels according to the following priority
order, reflecting the reliability of each classification: DESI, Binospec, DEEP3, SDSS
(spectroscopic classification), Gaia, HSC-SSP, and SDSS (photometric classification). Table 2
summarizes the labeled dataset, comprising 14 594 unique sources. The corresponding r-band
magnitude distributions of the retained sources from each survey are shown in Figure 4.
Figure 5 shows the r-band magnitude distributions of stars and galaxies for the
miniJPAS and J-NEP surveys. In both surveys, galaxies dominate at r ≳21, while stars
are more prevalent at r ≲18.5. This results in a class imbalance in the training set, which
can bias both the performance of the classifier and the interpretation of its metrics. To
avoid misleading conclusions from this imbalance, we evaluate performance using purity-
completeness curves, which provide a balanced view of classification quality independent of
the relative proportions of stars and galaxies.
Finally, Figure 6 shows the histogram of the magnitude differences between the SDSS
and J-PAS r-band total flux magnitudes for point sources. This provides an additional
crosscheck of the quality of the crossmatch. We restrict the analysis to point sources because
J-PAS does not provide a total-flux model magnitude for extended objects, as MAG_AUTO
is measured within an aperture of two Kron radii and therefore misses a non-negligible
fraction of the galaxy flux in the outskirts.
As stated earlier, we perform a binary classification into extended and point-like sources.
Point-like sources include both stars and QSOs, which are morphologically similar at the
J-PAS resolution. However, the number of spectroscopically confirmed QSOs in our sample
is insufficient to support a reliable three-class classification [13–17] that would exploit the
low-resolution J-PAS spectra. As is customary, we refer to extended sources as galaxies and
to point-like sources as stars throughout this paper.

The PSF is characterized as the mean full width at half maximum (FWHM) of point-like
sources in each tile, estimated with PSFEx [18]. The color excess E(B −V ) is the integrated
reddening due to Milky Way dust along the line of sight, provided at the position of each
source by the Bayestar17 three-dimensional dust map [19,20].
3.2. Photometric features
We used a total of 120 photometric features derived from the 60 J-PAS bands. Specif-
ically, we considered MAG_AUTO magnitudes and their associated uncertainties in each of
the 60 bands from MagABDualObj. Bands without detection were assigned a magnitude of
99, while the magnitude errors encapsulate valuable information about the strength and
reliability of each detection.
Although MagABDualPointSources provides PSF-corrected photometry (MAG_APER_
COR_3_0) optimized for point-like objects–shown to outperform MAG_AUTO for spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting and photometric redshift estimation–our classification
tests indicate a different trend. For the photometry-only model, MAG_AUTO yields better
results, with ROC AUC = 0.992 and star purity-completeness AUC = 0.984, compared
to 0.984 and 0.965 for MAG_APER_COR_3_0.11 For galaxies, the improvement is smaller but
still in favor of MAG_AUTO (AUC = 0.997 vs. 0.994). When morphology is included, the
two definitions perform nearly identically–0.1% better performance for MAG_APER_COR_3_0.
Given the superior performance of MAG_AUTO in the photometry-only case and its comparable
performance when morphology is included, we adopt MAG_AUTO as our default choice in this
work.
3.3. Morphological features
We adopted four morphological parameters derived from columns relative to the

Normalized peak surface brightness µ = MU_MAX/MAG_APER_3_0 (in the r-band), where
MU_MAX represents the peak surface brightness above the local background.
The spatial variation of the PSF across the J-PAS tiles introduces multimodality into
the distributions of concentration, FWHM, and peak surface brightness. To correct for
this effect and achieve uniform morphological features, we normalize each parameter by
subtracting the corresponding median stellar value computed within the same tile:
Xi
→
Xi −⟨X⟩stars, tile ,
(1)
where X denotes concentration, FWHM, or peak surface brightness.
This correction
effectively removes the multimodal behavior, as illustrated in Figure 7, which compares the
distributions before and after correction. In addition, the separation between stellar and
galactic populations becomes more pronounced following this normalization.
We do not apply this correction to the ellipticity, as it does not display multimodal
features and can take spurious values for stars. Due to the finite pixel scale, a narrow PSF
may lead SExtractor to assign A/B ̸= 1 to unresolved sources, introducing artificial shape
distortions caused by limitations in the PSF fitting procedure. See Bonoli et al. [1, App. C]
for the SExtractor configuration adopted.
We use the normalized morphological parameters for the representativeness analysis
presented in the next section. However, for the classification task, we retain the uncorrected
catalog values. Our tests show that including the PSF as an additional feature is sufficient to
account for its spatial variations and prevent confusion, while the normalization procedure
introduces additional complexity to the pipeline without yielding a significant improvement
in classification performance.

across feature space. Left (right) panel shows miniJPAS (J-NEP) sources plotted on top to enhance
visibility.
3.4. Feature sets
We perform three separate classifications. The first uses the full set of 128 features,
which includes 60 magnitudes with their associated errors, four morphological parameters,
the PSF information, Galactic extinction with its error, and detection flags. The second
is restricted to 123 features, consisting of the 60 magnitudes with their errors, Galactic
extinction with its error, and detection flags. We refer to these two configurations as
‘morphology+photometry‘ and ‘photometry only‘, respectively. The rationale for testing
the latter is that morphological parameters may be biased in tiles produced by combining
exposures taken under different observing conditions; in such cases, the tile-averaged PSF
may not adequately represent individual sources, making a photometry-only classification
potentially more robust.
In addition, we evaluate a third model based solely on morphological information,
comprising the four morphological parameters, PSF, and detection flags. This setup serves
as a benchmark to compare with the other models and, in particular, with the SGLC
classifier, thereby quantifying the performance gain provided by machine learning.
4. Supervised classification
4.1. Representativeness
The miniJPAS and J-NEP surveys were conducted using the same instrument and
filter system, though under slightly different observing conditions. To evaluate the reliability
and generalization capacity of the labeled datasets assembled in Section 2, we assess their
representativeness along two complementary directions:
1.
the internal consistency between the labeled miniJPAS and labeled J-NEP subsets;
2.
the external coverage of the full miniJPAS and J-NEP datasets by the combined
labeled set.
For this purpose, we adopt the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
(UMAP) algorithm [21], a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique designed to preserve
both local and global data structure in low-dimensional projections. Importantly, our use of
UMAP is diagnostic: we do not attempt classification in the embedded space, but rather
evaluate whether the labeled samples span the same feature manifold as the full catalogs.

Figure 9. UMAP projection of the combined labeled set and full miniJPAS and J-NEP catalogs,
showing representative coverage. Left (right) panel shows miniJPAS (J-NEP) sources plotted on
top to enhance visibility.
We apply UMAP to the 124 photometric and morphological features described in
Section 3, excluding the observational features listed in Section 3.1, as these are non–object-
specific or discrete and could introduce spurious clustering.
Figure 8 shows the two-
dimensional UMAP projection of the labeled miniJPAS and J-NEP sources. The J-NEP
subset is largely embedded within the distribution of miniJPAS, indicating that the two
labeled samples are consistent and can be reliably combined for model training. Figure 9
compares the combined labeled dataset against the full miniJPAS and J-NEP populations.12
The labeled set broadly spans the full feature space, confirming that it is sufficiently
representative to serve as a training base for supervised classification of the entire catalog. It
is important to note, however, that while the labeled set spans the overall feature space, this
does not guarantee that labeled stars (or galaxies) fully cover the star (or galaxy) subspaces
of the full catalogs.
4.2. TPOT pipeline for XGBoost optimization
Based on the results of von Marttens et al. [13], who compared several machine
learning algorithms, we adopt the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm [XGBoost, 22] for
classification. Given the relatively modest size of our labeled dataset (fewer than 15 000
objects), XGBoost is a suitable choice. While neural networks may outperform tree-based
models for substantially larger datasets, they are unlikely to offer significant advantages in
our case. XGBoost is an ensemble learning method based on decision trees and gradient
boosting. It iteratively adds new trees to correct the errors of the existing ensemble while
minimizing a regularized objective function, which balances prediction accuracy and model
complexity. This process results in a robust and efficient classifier that is well-suited for
structured tabular data. For technical details, see Chen and Guestrin [22].
The final hyperparameter configuration was selected using the Tree-based Pipeline
Optimization Tool [TPOT, 23],13 an automated machine learning framework that optimizes
machine learning pipelines through genetic programming. The number of pipelines evaluated
by TPOT depends on three key hyperparameters: generations, population size, and offspring
12
Note that the UMAP projection differs from that in Figure 8, so the two plots are not directly comparable
in terms of their coordinate positions.

size. These respectively control the number of optimization iterations, the number of
top-performing pipelines retained in each generation, and the number of new pipelines
generated per generation.
The total number of pipelines analyzed is given by Population Size + Generations
× Offspring Size. In this work, we set all three hyperparameters to 200, resulting in the
evaluation of 40,200 distinct pipelines. The final hyperparameter configuration is listed in
Appendix B. Model selection was performed exclusively within the training set, comprising
80% of the combined miniJPAS and J-NEP labeled samples. TPOT used 5-fold cross-
validation within this training set to optimize pipeline architectures and hyperparameters.
After optimization, the best-performing pipeline was retrained on the same 80% split, while
the remaining 20% was held out as an independent test set. This test set was used only once
for final evaluation, ensuring that the reported performance provides an unbiased estimate
of the model’s generalization ability.
4.3. Performance metrics
The XGBoost classifier outputs a probabilistic score between 0 (star) and 1 (galaxy),
requiring the choice of a classification threshold pcut to separate the two classes. Once
pcut is specified, the model’s performance can be evaluated using a 2 × 2 confusion matrix.
From its entries, we derive standard classification metrics such as the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve and the purity–completeness curve, which provide graphical
assessments of classifier performance.
The ROC curve is a parametric plot of the true positive rate (TPR) versus the false
positive rate (FPR) as a function of pcut:
TPR(pcut) =
TP
TP + FN ,
FPR(pcut) =
FP
FP + TN ,
(2)
where TP, FN, FP, and TN are the entries of the confusion matrix. TPR corresponds
to recall, commonly referred to as completeness in astronomy. A commonly used scalar
summary of the ROC curve is the area under the curve (AUC), which ranges from 0.5
(random classifier) to 1 (perfect classifier).
To account for class imbalance in the training set, we also consider the purity-
completeness curve. It is a parametric plot of the purity (or precision) versus the completeness
(or recall) as a function of pcut:
Purity(pcut) =
TP
TP + FP ,
Completeness(pcut) =
TP
TP + FN .
(3)
A compact summary of this curve is given by the average precision (AP), defined as the
area under the purity–completeness curve. AP values range from 0 to 1, with higher values
indicating better classification performance.
5. Results
5.1. Metrics
Figure 10 shows the ROC curves for the three XGBoost models: photometry only
(123 features, top), morphology only (6 features, middle), and morphology+photometry
(128 features, bottom). For comparison, we also include the performance of SGLC and
CLASS_STAR, the neural-network classifier implemented in SExtractor [24]. The photometry-
only model outperforms CLASS_STAR and achieves performance comparable to, and slightly
better than, SGLC. It also surpasses the morphology-only model, which performs as SGLC.
The morphology+photometry model is the best overall, yielding the highest ROC AUC
and thus the most accurate classifications. The same figure also shows the purity and

completeness curves for galaxies (second column) and stars (third column). Despite the
class imbalance in the training set, stars are well classified, with only a modest reduction in
average precision (area under the purity-completeness curve).
Figure 11 shows the confusion matrices for the models based on photometry only (top
row) and on photometry combined with morphology (bottom row), evaluated in three r-band
magnitude bins. A classification threshold of pcut = 0.5 is used throughout. As expected,
classification performance deteriorates at fainter magnitudes, primarily due to stars being
increasingly misclassified as galaxies. The inclusion of morphological features significantly
mitigates this effect, confining most misclassifications to the faintest bin (r > 22.5). In
contrast, the classification of galaxies remains consistently accurate across all bins.
Figure 12 shows the purity and completeness for galaxies and stars as functions of the
r-band magnitude, evaluated at a fixed target value of 95%. In each magnitude bin, this is
achieved by selecting the probability threshold pcut that yields the desired classification level.
Results are presented in discrete magnitude bins (top panels) and cumulatively (bottom
panels), for XGBoost models trained with photometry only and with photometry plus
morphology, compared against SGLC. Galaxy classifications remain highly accurate across
all magnitudes. For stars, performance degrades at faint magnitudes, but improves with the
inclusion of morphology, surpassing SGLC. The apparent drop at r > 22.5 in the binned
results is explained by the very small number of faint stars in the training set (see Figure 5)
and does not significantly affect the cumulative statistics.
5.2. Misclassifications
Misclassifications are dominated by faint stars (r > 21) erroneously labeled as galaxies.
Two effects drive this: (i) a brightness imbalance in the training set (relatively brighter
stars and fainter galaxies) and (ii) color/SED degeneracy in photometry-only models at low

SNR. Adding morphology largely mitigates the problem—star→galaxy errors drop sharply
and galaxy→star errors are essentially removed. At the faint end, however, stellar and
galactic morphologies converge, increasing ambiguity. This is evident in Figure 13, where
the normalized peak surface brightness µ drifts toward the stellar reference; the same trend
appears in the photometry-only model. Thus, morphology reduces the rate of mistakes but
does not fully break the underlying degeneracies, indicating that part of the confusion arises
from photometric/SED similarity in faint sources. These results align with von Marttens
et al. [13] and suggest that more sophisticated treatment of photometry (e.g., improved
uncertainty handling) could yield further gains.
To investigate whether additional factors contribute to the misclassifications, Figure 14
shows the fraction of stars classified as galaxies by survey of origin within the test set.
No clear trends are observed, excluding the possibility that stellar misclassifications are
mainly due to incorrect truth labels. We also examined misclassifications as a function of
flags, but the numbers were negligible. Finally, Appendix D presents visual inspections of
representative misclassifications across both models and magnitude ranges.
5.3. Stellar locus
Figure 15 shows the stellar locus. The dashed line is a fourth-degree polynomial fit to
all labeled stars, overplotted on the 2D histogram to guide the reader’s eye. Red markers
show the XGBoost predictions from the full value-added catalog (VAC) using the model
with photometry (left) and photometry and morphology (right): each point corresponds to
the median value in a bin, with error bars indicating the 16th and 84th percentiles. The
predicted locus closely follows the reference across the magnitude range, consistent with the
high stellar purity reported in Figure 11.
5.4. Feature importance
To evaluate the relative contribution of each feature group, we computed permutation
importance on the test set. This metric measures the change in ROC AUC when the values
of a given feature group are randomly permuted, thereby breaking its relationship with the
target. A larger drop corresponds to higher importance. Small negative values (i.e., a slight
increase in AUC after permutation) do not imply that a feature ’confuses’ the classifier;
they typically arise from sampling noise on a finite test set and/or correlations with other
features. We therefore interpret such negative importances as statistically consistent with
zero (non-informative) importance.

Figure 16 shows the permutation importance results for the XGBoost model trained
with photometry only. The most informative features are the three broad bands i, g, and r,
together with three narrow bands: J0460 (4603 Å), J0680 (6812 Å), and J0390 (3904 Å).
These results are consistent with those of Baqui et al. [5, Figure 13], who found peaks in
feature importance around 4000 and 6900 Å. This suggests that the model exploits these
wavelengths to estimate the slope of the spectral energy distribution.
Figure 17 shows the results for the XGBoost model trained with photometry and
morphology. The most informative features are the concentration index cr and the normalized
peak surface brightness µ, followed by the PSF. FWHM and photometry also contribute,
while ellipticity (A/B), extinction E(B −V ) with its error, and detection flags have
negligible impact. This reflects the fact that miniJPAS and J-NEP each cover only about
1 deg2, where Milky Way extinction varies very little. The results therefore confirm that
morphological features carry the dominant information for effective star–galaxy separation
in these fields.
6. Conclusions
The machine learning-based classification of J-NEP and miniJPAS sources presented
in this paper improves star-galaxy separation compared to previous methods. Using an
XGBoost classifier with hyperparameters tuned through automated optimization, trained
on a robust labeled dataset derived from crossmatching with multiple spectroscopic and
photometric catalogs, we provide reliable classifications both from purely photometric data
and from combined photometric and morphological features.
Our key findings can be summarized as follows:
1.
The XGBoost model combining photometric and morphological features achieves a
higher area under the ROC curve and outperforms both the SGLC and CLASS_STAR
classifiers across all magnitude ranges.
2.
Using photometry alone yields competitive performance, slightly surpassing SGLC,
but leads to misclassifications of faint stars as galaxies at r > 22. This ambiguity is
reduced when morphological features are included.
3.
The permutation importance analysis identifies the concentration, normalized peak
surface brightness, and PSF as critical morphological parameters for classification.
Photometric bands at approximately 3900, 4600, and 6800 Å are consistently among
the most informative, highlighting their relevance for characterizing stellar and galactic
spectral slopes.
4.
The UMAP representativeness analysis demonstrates the robustness and consistency
of the labeled training set, validating its applicability for reliable classification across
the full miniJPAS and J-NEP datasets.
5.
Our ML pipeline, publicly released as a value-added catalog (VAC), offers reliable

Appendix B. Hyperparameter configuration
The best-performing pipeline identified by TPOT consists of a MaxAbsScaler for fea-
ture scaling followed by an XGBClassifier. The choice of XGBoost is further supported
by von Marttens et al. [13], which–although based on 12 photometric bands in J-PLUS
rather than the 60 in J-PAS–uses the same morphological features and comparable photo-
metric coverage. In that study, TPOT systematically evaluated multiple machine learning
algorithms and identified XGBoost as the top performer. The consistency between the two
surveys thus provides a strong justification for adopting XGBoost in our analysis. The final
hyperparameter configuration is as follows:
•
booster=gbtree: specifies the tree-based boosting model, suitable for structured
tabular data.
•
colsample_bylevel=0.6: fraction of features sampled for each tree level, reducing
overfitting by introducing randomness.
•
colsample_bynode=1.0: fraction of features sampled for each split, set to 1 (all
features used).
•
colsample_bytree=0.9: fraction of features sampled for each tree, promoting diversity
among trees.
•
gamma=0.5: minimum loss reduction required for further partitioning; larger values
make the model more conservative.
•
learning_rate=0.05: step size shrinkage, balancing learning speed with generaliza-
tion.
•
max_depth=7: maximum depth of each tree, controlling model complexity.
•
min_child_weight=5: minimum sum of instance weights in a child node; higher values
prevent overfitting small fluctuations.
•
n_estimators=600: number of boosting rounds (trees).
•
objective=binary:logistic: specifies binary classification with probabilistic out-
puts.
•
reg_alpha=0: L1 regularization term, promoting sparsity in weights; set to zero here.
•
reg_lambda=1: L2 regularization term, penalizing large weights to reduce overfitting.
•
scale_pos_weight=3.46: weighting factor to address class imbalance between stars
and galaxies.
•
subsample=0.95: fraction of training instances sampled for each tree, preventing
overfitting by adding stochasticity.
This configuration balances model flexibility and regularization, effectively handling the im-
balance between stellar and galactic classes while maintaining robustness against overfitting.
Appendix C. Treatment of Ambiguous Crossmatches
In crossmatching miniJPAS and J-NEP with external spectroscopic catalogs (DEEP3,
Binospec, and DESI), ambiguous matches may arise when multiple J-PAS sources fall within
the matching radius of the same external catalog object. By default, onexmatch resolves
duplicates by retaining only the closest J-PAS source for each catalog entry. However, when

bars show non-ambiguous cases.
two candidate sources are nearly equidistant from the same object, this procedure may not
be reliable. To address such cases, we adopted an ambiguity threshold of 0.5 arcsec, which
is approximately twice the pixel scale and comparable to the PSF size. If the positional
difference between two candidate matches is below this threshold, the association is deemed
ambiguous and the sources are discarded from the final crossmatch, see Figure C1. This
conservative approach minimizes spurious associations, ensuring that the resulting training
set retains only high-confidence matches.
Appendix D. Visual inspection of misclassifications
Here we present a visual inspection of misclassifications produced by the models trained
with photometric information only and with combined photometric and morphological
information. Representative examples were selected to cover the full magnitude range
considered in this work. This qualitative analysis complements the statistical results by
illustrating typical failure modes and offering insights into possible improvements for future
modeling.
Each panel of Figures D1 and D2 displays the spectral energy distribution across the
60 J-PAS bands, with broad-band points shown as squares, together with an RGB cutout
from the r, i, and g bands (inset). The examples include galaxies misclassified as point-like
sources and point-like objects (stars or QSOs) misclassified as galaxies. For each case, we
report the object ID, sky coordinates, survey origin, classifier probability (1 = star, 0 =
galaxy), r-band magnitude, PSF, FWHM, and ellipticity A/B.
