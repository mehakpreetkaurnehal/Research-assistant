Abstract
Information-seeking is a core capability for AI
agents, requiring them to gather and reason over
tool-generated information across long trajec-
tories. However, such multi-step information-
seeking tasks remain challenging for agents
backed by language models. While process re-
ward models (PRMs) can guide agents by ranking
candidate steps at test-time, existing PRMs, de-
signed for short reasoning with binary judgment,
cannot capture richer dimensions of information-
seeking steps, such as tool interactions and rea-
soning over tool outputs, nor handle the rapidly
growing context in long-horizon tasks. To ad-
dress these limitations, we introduce PRINTS,
a generative PRM trained with dual capabilities:
(1) dense scoring based on the PRM’s reason-
ing across multiple step quality dimensions (e.g.,
interpretation of tool outputs, tool call informa-
tiveness) and (2) trajectory summarization that
compresses the growing context while preserving
essential information for step evaluation. Exten-
sive evaluations across FRAMES, GAIA (levels
1-3), and WebWalkerQA (easy-hard) benchmarks
on multiple models, along with ablations, reveal
that best-of-n sampling with PRINTS enhances
information-seeking abilities of open-source mod-
els as well as specialized agents, matching or sur-
passing the performance of frontier models with a
much smaller backbone agent and outperforming
other strong reward modeling baselines.1
1. Introduction
A long-standing goal in artificial intelligence has been to
develop agents that can answer novel queries by intelli-
gently seeking information (Bachman et al., 2016; Yuan
et al., 2020), thereby enabling them to tackle challenging

tasks in mathematics (Liu et al., 2025a;b), software engineer-
ing (Yang et al., 2025b; Pan et al., 2024), and research (Li
et al., 2025b; Wu et al., 2025a). Large Language Mod-
els (LLMs) have shown promise as agents for such tasks
when equipped with frameworks like ReAct (Yao et al.,
2023), which interleaves LLM reasoning with external tool
interactions. However, long-horizon information-seeking
tasks, which require agents to gather and synthesize infor-
mation across multiple steps (Su et al., 2025; Shao et al.,
2025), remain challenging, even for recent LLMs with tool-
use training, performing far below human-level (Mialon
et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2025). While finetuning LLMs as
information-seeking agents has shown promise (Li et al.,
2025b; Wu et al., 2025a; Tao et al., 2025), it is limited to
specific model families and is highly computationally de-
manding (Gao et al., 2025). An alternative way to boost a
variety of agents is to build reward models (e.g., as done
for math reasoning and instruction following (Wang et al.,
2024a; Zou et al., 2025)). These models approximate the
expected reward of a step or sequence of steps, enabling
test-time scaling by ranking and selecting higher-quality
actions or trajectories to successfully tackle long-horizon
tasks. Specifically, Process Reward Models (PRMs) (Zou
et al., 2025; Choudhury, 2025; Chae et al., 2025) offer a
promising model-agnostic way of improving performance,
scoring the quality of each of an agent’s steps.
While past work has developed PRMs for tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, these methods are in-
sufficient for long-horizon information-seeking tasks for
two critical reasons. (1) Tool-Reasoning Evaluation Gran-
ularity: existing PRMs evaluate short reasoning units in
isolation, typically one- to two-sentence logical or mathe-
matical inferences (Xiong et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2025),
providing binary judgments based on logical/math valid-
ity. In contrast, long-horizon information-seeking requires
jointly evaluating a complete trajectory step, which encom-
passes a reasoning step combined with tool interactions (e.g.,
web search, web browsing, code execution). Moreover, step
quality depends on multiple factors (e.g., interpretation of
tool outputs, tool call informativeness, plan for next action)
that coarse feedback cannot capture, increasing the granular-
ity of the guidance needed to effectively steer agents toward
good trajectories. (2) Context Accumulation: existing
PRMs cannot manage the ever-growing reasoning context

Figure 1. Comparison between existing PRMs and PRINTS. Top: Existing PRMs are limited for long-horizon information-seeking as
they evaluate a short reasoning unit (e.g., one-to-two-sentence inferences) with coarse feedback, which cannot capture multi-faceted
quality factors from tool interactions. They also struggle with rapidly accumulating reasoning context (left). Bottom: In contrast, PRINTS
evaluates a complete trajectory step (reasoning + tool interactions), considers multiple trajectory step quality dimensions to produce dense
scores for finer-grained guidance at each step, and maintains compact trajectory summaries that keep key information for the evaluation.
that arises over multiple trajectory steps. As illustrated
in Figure 1 (Top-left), the information-seeking trajectory
– interleaving reasoning steps, tool calls, and tool call out-
puts – grows rapidly as tool responses at each step introduce
lengthy, noisy content, creating computational overhead.
Furthermore, recent studies show that models struggle to
process long, accumulated contexts (Tang et al., 2025; Yen
et al., 2025; Kuratov et al., 2024), resulting in noisy evalua-
tions. This necessitates compressing trajectories into com-
pact forms instead of processing entire historical contexts.
Our work aims to fill these gaps by introducing Progress
Reward via Information gain scoring and Trajectory
Summarization (PRINTS), a novel generative PRM for
long-horizon information-seeking tasks. PRINTS is a uni-
fied model jointly trained with two key abilities to address
both the need for fine-grained guidance and the challenge
of context accumulation. These two abilities are learned
jointly within the same PRM. First, PRINTS acts as a scorer
that evaluates candidate next trajectory steps by generating
Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022) analyses across multi-
ple quality dimensions and outputting dense scores derived
from this generative reasoning, as illustrated in (Figure 1
(Bottom)). Crucially, we frame step evaluation as informa-
tion gain estimation that quantifies how much each trajec-
tory step increases the probability of reaching the correct
answer. This formulation enables training via reinforcement
learning with information gain estimation and preference
prediction objectives, providing richer reward signals that
account for the multi-faceted quality of trajectory steps. At
test-time, PRINTS evaluates n candidate next steps, select-
ing the step expected to yield the greatest information gain.
Second, PRINTS simultaneously functions as a summarizer
that recursively generates and updates a compact trajectory
summary at each step. PRINTS compresses the query, pre-
vious summary, latest tool response, and current step into an
updated summary that captures essential findings and plans
up to the current timestep (Figure 1 (Bottom)). This keeps
input length bounded, as shown in Figure 1 (Bottom-left),
while preserving information for subsequent evaluation.
To equip PRINTS with these dual capabilities, we first
design preference and summary data that can produce super-
vision signals needed to train the scoring and summarization
components. Specifically, our annotation pipeline (Figure 3)
uses Monte Carlo rollouts (Wang et al., 2024a; Setlur et al.,
2025) to estimate information gain scores and construct
preference trajectory step pairs, and generates compact tra-
jectory summaries for each step. Next, we use this annotated
data to train PRINTS via reinforcement learning for scor-
ing ability with two complementary rewards: (1) a Score
Reward that teaches the model to analyze the trajectory
step quality and estimate the step’s information gain score,
and (2) a Comparison Reward that teaches the model to
assign higher scores to preferred trajectory steps by learning
from pairwise preferences. These rewards enable the model
to capture the multi-faceted quality of the trajectory step
and perform dense step-level evaluation. We jointly train
PRINTS via supervised fine-tuning for summarization that
recursively updates the trajectory summary based on the pre-
vious summary and most recent reasoning context at each
step, directly addressing the context accumulation challenge
while preserving key information needed for step-level eval-
uation. Together, this pipeline enables PRINTS to serve
as a unified PRM capable of both managing long, noisy
trajectories and providing fine-grained test-time guidance.
We validate our approach across three distinct LLMs
used as information-seeking agents: Qwen3-32B (Yang
et al., 2025a), Tongyi DeepResearch-30B-A3B (Li et al.,
2025a) – a specialized information-seeking agent – and
Gemini-2.5-Flash (Gemini Team, 2025), evaluated on three
long-horizon information-seeking benchmarks: FRAMES,
GAIA, and WebWalkerQA. The experimental results show
that PRINTS, a 4B PRM, consistently provides test-
time gains across diverse agents – Qwen3-32B by 9.3%,
2

PRINTS : Reward Modeling for Long-Horizon Information Seeking
DeepResearch-30B-A3B by 3.9%, and Gemini-2.5-Flash by
4.0% absolute average accuracy – without fine-tuning the
underlying models. Unlike existing PRMs, which obtain di-
minished and inconsistent gains as agents become stronger,
PRINTS continues to deliver substantial improvements. No-
tably, on GAIA (levels 1-3) (Mialon et al., 2024), PRINTS
raises DeepResearch-30B-A3B from 61.9% to 64.4% in our
implementation, enabling the 30B agent augmented with
the 4B PRM to match the performance of OpenAI Deep-
Research (67.4%) and DeepSeek-V3.1-671B (63.1%) (Li
et al., 2025a). Furthermore, our ablation studies reveal that
providing compressed summaries outperforms using raw tra-
jectories as input context, showing that context management
is essential for accurate step-level evaluation in long-horizon
tasks. Overall, our approach enhances information-seeking
abilities of pretrained open-source models as well as spe-
cialized agents. showing strong generalizability.
2. Related Work
Large Language Models (LLM) as Agents.
LLMs have
been increasingly adopted as agents through frameworks
such as ReAct (Yao et al., 2023), which integrates rea-
soning with external tool interactions to solve complex
tasks (Deng et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025c). To facilitate ef-
fective information-seeking behaviors that require multiple
reasoning steps and tool interactions to reach a final answer,
recent studies (Li et al., 2025b; Tao et al., 2025; Li et al.,
2025a) aim to improve the intrinsic quality of information-
seeking trajectories. For instance, both WebSailor (Li et al.,
2025b), WebShaper (Tao et al., 2025), DeepResearch (Li
et al., 2025a) agents synthesize large-scale QA training data
by injecting uncertainty into structured knowledge to teach
LLMs to reduce the search space by discovering unknown
variables. However, training LLMs for long-horizon tasks
shares key limitations: (1) it requires substantial supervi-
sion (MiroMind AI Team, 2025; Li et al., 2025a) and (2) it
requires access to model weights, which poses challenges
for generalization whenever the underlying model changes.
We empirically show that PRINTS enhances agent perfor-
mance, indicating that test-time guidance and agent fine-
tuning are orthogonal yet mutually beneficial directions for
improving information-seeking capabilities.
Reward Models for Reasoning.
To measure reasoning
quality, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) are used to pre-
dict the correctness of complete reasoning trajectories (Kim
et al., 2024; Pan et al., 2024). Consequently, ORMs can-
not provide finer-grained, step-wise guidance over partial
trajectories. Process Reward Models (PRMs) address this
limitation by evaluating and assigning rewards for individ-
ual steps (Ton et al., 2024; He et al., 2025; Chen et al.,
2025).
Recent advancements cast PRMs as generative
judges (Wang et al., 2024b; Whitehouse et al., 2025; He
et al., 2025) that generate justifications for step scores and
have achieved strong performance in mathematics (Zhao
et al., 2025; Xiong et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024a), fi-
nance (Zhou et al., 2025), and agentic tasks (Chae et al.,
2025; Choudhury, 2025). In contrast to these existing PRM
approaches that rank the validity of relatively short reason-
ing snippets and struggle with managing growing contexts,
PRINTS is equipped with jointly evaluating reasoning with
tool interactions, planning for subsequent actions across
multiple dimensions of “information gain” in tandem with
a compact trajectory summarization mechanism, inspired
by approaches that compress reasoning histories and have
shown success in context length reduction (Wu et al., 2025c;
Kang et al., 2025; Ye et al., 2025).
3. PRINTS: Progress Reward via Information
Gain Score and Trajectory Summarization
We start by introducing the framework that quantifies and
annotates the quality of each trajectory step – a reasoning
step combined with a tool call – followed by reinforcement
learning that uses these annotations to train PRINTS as a
scorer (Section 3.2). Next, we describe our approach for
generating compact summaries of long interaction trajecto-
ries, and explain how these summaries are used to train the
same PRINTS as a summarizer (Section 3.3). The overall
design of PRINTS is illustrated in Figure 2.
3.1. Preliminaries
To tackle long-horizon information-seeking problems, we
adopt the agentic ReAct (Yao et al., 2023) paradigm, where
a Large Language Model (LLM) acts as an agent that in-
terleaves reasoning with tool-based action toward the goal
of answering query q (Tao et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025a).
At each timestep t, the agent may generate intermediate
reasoning st based on the current context and then predict
the subsequent action at, i.e., calls to external tools, such as
web search, web browsing, and code execution, to acquire
new information. The resulting tool response ot is observed
and added to the context, which informs the agent’s reason-
ing at timestep t+1. Figure 2 (Left) visually shows this tool
interaction process: st, at, ot correspond to reasoning, tool
call, tool response at timestep t. This process repeats until
timestep T, when the agent submits its answer oT . The task
is successful if oT matches the ground-truth answer a∗. The
accumulated reasoning context up to timestep t, referred to
as the information-seeking trajectory, is defined as:
Ht = (s1, a1, o1, s2, a2, o2, . . . , st, at, ot)
(1)
Specifically, the agent π generates the next reasoning step
and tool call conditioned on the query and information-
seeking trajectory, i.e., st, at ∼π (·|q,Ht−1). Then the
tool call is executed to get the tool response ot. This in-

Figure 2. Overview of PRINTS. Left: PRINTS functions as a scorer, evaluating agent’s multiple candidate next trajectory steps based on
the summarized context and current tool response. It generates an analysis and a dense score for each candidate, selecting the top-scoring
one to guide the agent’s information-seeking. Right: PRINTS acts as a summarizer, recursively updating a compact information-seeking
trajectory summary to keep input length bounded and preserve key information for its subsequent score evaluation.
terleaving of reasoning and action has shown success in
long-horizon information-seeking tasks (Li et al., 2025b;
Gao et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025a), and thus we adopt this
setting. However, applying PRMs to guide long-horizon
information seeking of the agent faces two key challenges:
trajectory steps contain substantially richer content than
traditional steps, requiring multi-dimensional evaluation be-
yond simple correctness, and the accumulated context Ht
grows rapidly, producing a long, noisy input context, which
makes it difficult to identify evaluation evidence. Thus, we
next introduce our data annotation and train pipeline, which
equips PRINTS with two core capabilities: (1) dense step-
level scoring for fine-grained guidance, and (2) trajectory
summarization for effective step-level evaluation under a
rapidly accumulating input context.
3.2. Step-level Information Gain Estimation
Information Gain Score.
To train a Process Reward
Model (PRM) for long-horizon information seeking, we
need to measure how much each reasoning step and tool
call contributes towards reaching the correct answer. To
this end, we define information gain of the current step as
the change in expected likelihood of arriving at the correct
answer before and after taking the current step (Rao & III,
2018; Prasad et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024a). This local
evaluation quantifies the marginal improvement in task suc-
cess contributed by the current step. Specifically, for a rea-
soning step and tool call (st, at) preceded by information-
seeking trajectory prefix, Ht−1, we use Monte Carlo esti-
mation (Wang et al., 2024a; Xiong et al., 2025; Setlur et al.,
2025) by executing M rollouts until their final answers are
produced and compute the mean accuracy:
mt =
PM
j=1 1(o(j)
Tj = a∗)
M
,
(2)
where o(j)
Tj ∼π(·|q,Ht−1,st,at) is the final answer from
rollout j, which terminates at timestep Tj. The information
gain score gt is then computed as:
gt = (mt −mt−1) × M/2,
(3)
which quantifies how much (st, at) contributes to the suc-
cessful completion of the task. We scale by M/2 to obtain
scores in the range [−M/2, M/2]. A positive gt indicates
that the current step (st, at) increases the probability of
reaching the correct answer – for example, through logically
coherent reasoning or a tool call that resolves uncertainties –
whereas a gt lower than zero indicates that the current step
reduces the probability, e.g., by making unverified assump-
tions or invoking an irrelevant tool call.
Trajectory Score Annotations.
While prior approaches
annotate individual trajectory steps in isolation (Xiong et al.,
2025; Wang et al., 2024a) or use imitation learning to learn
directly from precomputed step-level scores (Wang et al.,
2024a), Whitehouse et al. (2025) demonstrates that pairwise
preference learning is effective for training robust judge
models. We extend this by automatically constructing prefer-
ence pairs grounded in information gain scores, then training
PRINTS with complementary objectives – a score reward
for information gain estimation and a comparison reward
for preference prediction – as illustrated in Figure 3 (Top).
During the M rollouts performed to calculate gt, the
LLM generates a set of M unique next trajectory steps
{s(j)
t+1,a(j)
t+1}M
j=1 and the corresponding final answer predic-
tions {o(j)
Tj ∼π

·|q,Ht,s(j)
t+1,a(j)
t+1

}M
j=1. As shown in Fig-
ure 3 (Top-left), to construct a candidate preference pair, we
first select one trajectory step that (1) leads to a successful
final answer and (2) achieves the shortest successful tra-
jectory, assuming this step has the highest potential to be
both effective and efficient among the M rollouts. A second
trajectory step is then randomly sampled from the remaining
steps, assuming that it provides a contrasting, less effective
reasoning (i.e., one that either leads to an incorrect answer
or reaches the correct answer through a longer trajectory).
Next, we annotate the information gain scores of this can-
didate preference pair by treating each trajectory step as a
new starting point and running M rollouts to estimate their
respective mean accuracies and information gain scores. Af-
ter annotation, the winning and losing labels are reassigned

Figure 3. PRINTS: data annotation and training pipeline. Top: For each trajectory step, we estimate the information gain score via
Monte Carlo rollouts as the change in mean answer accuracy before and after the step. Then we construct winning-losing step pairs based
on these scores (left). Preference pair examples are shown in Figure 7. Then we train PRINTS as a scorer via GRPO on these pairs (right).
The final reward combines a score reward for accurate prediction, a comparison reward for pairwise preference learning, and an adaptive
weight to mitigate noisy annotations. Bottom: Each step is annotated with a compact, recursively updated trajectory summary capturing
essential findings and plans up to the step (left). The same PRM is jointly trained as a summarizer via SFT on this summary data (right).
based on the actual information gain scores: the step with the
higher score becomes the true winning sample (s+
t+1,a+
t+1),
while the other becomes the losing sample (s−
t+1,a−
t+1). The
winning step then serves as the starting point for generating
the next pair at step t + 2. This contrastive labeling ensures
that PRINTS learns relative preferences between trajectory
steps grounded in empirically estimated improvements.
Training the PRM as a Scorer.
The core function of
PRINTS is to assess information-seeking trajectory step
quality and assign higher scores to steps expected to yield
greater information gain. To this end, we train PRINTS to
evaluate the trajectory step quality by predicting information
gain scores. Given a query q, trajectory summary ht−1 (in-
troduce in Section 3.3 below), the latest tool response ot−1,
and trajectory step (st, at), PRINTS generates a Chain-of-
Thought analysis and outputs a scalar score prediction ˆgt:
ˆgt = fI(q, ht−1,ot−1,st,at),
(4)
where fI denotes PRINTS that works as an information
gain scorer function. We train this scoring capability using
GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) with the following rewards: (1)
a score reward (rs) that targets minimizing the discrepancy
between the predicted score (ˆgt) and the ground-truth score
(gt), and (2) a comparison reward (rc) that enforces pairwise
preferences derived from annotated pairs:

the winning or losing sample, y+ = 1 and y−= −1 for
comparison direction, ¯k denotes its counterpart, N is the
number of rollouts, and ˆg¯k
j is the predicted score of j-th
rollout from the counterpart. For simplicity, we omit rollout-
and step-level indices, which do not affect the underlying
formulation of the scores. The comparison reward ensures
PRINTS learns to distinguish better from worse reasoning
paths, while the score reward provides fine-grained feed-
back on estimation accuracy. Finally, we combine the two
rewards into a single scalar per rollout with an adaptive
weight based on the ground-truth score margin:
rk = rk
s + w ∗rk
c , w = g+ −g−
M
,
(6)
where w is the comparison reward weight set for each pair.
This adaptive weighting addresses noise in the automatically
annotated preference pairs. Pairs with large score margins
between winning and losing samples (g+ −g−) are more re-
liably ranked and receive higher comparison weights, while
pairs with small margins receive lower weights, as they may
reflect annotation noise rather than true preference (Prasad
et al., 2024). This weighting scheme amplifies strong pref-
erence signals while mitigating the impact of noisy annota-
tions. The combined reward thus encourages PRINTS both
to estimate absolute scores accurately and to learn robust
preferences in information-seeking trajectories.

plosion hinders PRMs from efficient processing and results
in noise and distraction in quality evaluation. To this end,
we further extract a concise summary of the information-
seeking trajectory of each trajectory step (st,at). This sum-
mary, ht, captures the essential findings and plan develop-
ment up to timestep t. As illustrated in Figure 3 (Bottom-
left), each summary is recursively updated and generated
by an LLM, incorporating the previous summary ht−1, the
latest tool response ot−1, and the current trajectory step
(st, at) (i.e., ht = LLM(q,ht−1,ot−1,st,at). This recursive
formulation ensures that ht maintains a compressed form of
the entire trajectory Ht, with a bounded input length.
Training the PRM as a Summarizer.
To enable efficient
processing of the reasoning context during the score estima-
tion, PRINTS is trained to generate concise summaries that
retain only the essential context:
ˆht = fS(q, ht−1,ot−1,st,at),
(7)
where fS is PRINTS that works as a summarization func-
tion, and ˆht is the summary generated by PRINTS. We use
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the annotated summaries ht
of trajectory steps, which allows PRINTS to learn effective
summarization by imitating the provided annotations.
4. Experiments
4.1. Experimental Setup
Models.
To evaluate the efficacy and generalizability of
PRINTS, we use three distinct LLMs: Qwen3-32B (Yang
et al., 2025a), an open-source model with strong reason-
ing capability; Gemini-2.5-Flash (Gemini Team, 2025), a
closed-source frontier model; and Tongyi DeepResearch-
30B-A3B (Li et al., 2025a), a recently developed agent
specifically optimized for long-horizon information-seeking
tasks. We instantiate ReAct-based agents using these LLMs
and evaluate them using the Inspect-Eval (AI Security Insti-
tute, 2024) evaluation environment. Further details on the
evaluation environment are provided in Section A.
Evaluation Benchmarks.
Following recent work on long-
horizon information-seeking agents (Gao et al., 2025; Li
et al., 2025c;a), we assess the effectiveness of PRM-guided
reasoning on three benchmarks: FRAMES (Krishna et al.,
2025), GAIA (Mialon et al., 2024), and WebWalkerQA (Wu
et al., 2025b). GAIA evaluates general assistant capabil-
ities on complex retrieval and multi-step reasoning tasks
spanning three difficulty levels (Level 1-3).
WebWalk-
erQA requires agents to traverse webpages to gather ev-
idence across Easy-Hard levels. FRAMES contains factual
and reasoning-intensive queries that require multiple re-
trieval steps. For Qwen3-32B and DeepResearch agent, we
evaluate across FRAMES, GAIA, and WebWalkerQA. For
Gemini-2.5-Flash, we evaluate on GAIA. Further explana-
tions of these benchmarks are provided in Section A.
Evaluation Metric.
Following past work (Gao et al.,
2025; Li et al., 2025c;a), we adopt the LLM-as-Judge (LasJ)
paradigm to measure benchmark performance, which is
a standard approach in long-horizon information-seeking
research. We use GPT-5 to judge the correctness of final
answers. All results are reported using Avg@3, defined as
the mean accuracy over three independent runs.
Baselines.
We compare PRINTS againts three categories
of baselines: (1) Base agent: this directly uses the LLM’s
information-seeking abilities without any PRM guidance.
This serves as a reference to measure the test-time improve-
ment achieved by PRM-based guidance. (2) Intrinsic rea-
soning heuristics: we include widely used reasoning quality
heuristics, including confidence (Ghasemabadi et al., 2025),
relevance (Wan et al., 2025), and verbal-progress. (3) Ex-
isting PRMs: we compare with existing PRMs: GenPRM-
7B (Zhao et al., 2025), Web-Shepherd-8B (Chae et al.,
2025), StepWiser (Xiong et al., 2025). To provide a con-
trolled comparison, we follow StepWiser’s training protocol
to reimplement StepWiser using our annotated data and
Qwen3-4B model, adapting it to long-horizon information-
seeking tasks. This setup allows us to directly demonstrate
the contributions of PRINTS’s design; dense comparative
scoring and compact trajectory summarization. Further de-
tails of the baseline are provided in Section A.
Implementation Details.
Our dataset consists of ∼2k
preference trajectory step pairs with score and summary an-
notations drawn from publicly available web-agent training
corpora (MiroMind Data Team, 2025). We use Qwen3-32B
to generate both the information gain score and summary
annotation for each step with Monte Carlo rollouts M = 8.
PRINTS is instantiated as Qwen3-4B and trained with an
alternating SFT-GRPO schedule, where one epoch of SFT
for the summarization objective is followed by a period of
GRPO training for the scoring objective with GRPO roll-
outs N = 4. This SFT-GRPO cycle is repeated iteratively
throughout training, enabling PRINTS to jointly acquire
summarization and scoring abilities. At test-time, all base-
lines and PRINTS evaluate sets of candidate next steps
output by LLMs, performing best-of-n guided search with
n = 4. Further details can be found in Section A.

The results show that PRINTS enhances the performance of strong information-seeking agents.
4.2. Results and Discussion
PRINTS substantially outperforms existing PRMs
on foundation models.
Table 1 presents long-horizon
information-seeking task results using the open-source
Qwen3-32B as the LLM agent. Across all benchmarks,
including FRAMES, GAIA, and WebWalkerQA, PRINTS
consistently achieves substantial gains over the base agent.
For instance, on GAIA Level 1 and 2, PRINTS surpasses
the base agent by 14.5% and 9.6% absolute accuracy, re-
spectively, whereas other baselines yield only marginal im-
provements or sometimes even reduce performance. Al-
though StepWiser is trained on the same annotated dataset
as PRINTS, it provides only a 1.5% absolute average ac-
curacy gain (cf. 9.3% improvement with PRINTS). This
illustrates the limitation of binary correctness signals, which
provide only coarse supervision and fail to capture multiple
quality dimensions that influence the usefulness of a tra-
jectory step in long-horizon information seeking. However,
even baselines that generate richer outputs do not bridge this
gap. Verbal-progress – which produces scalar progress esti-
mates – and Web-Shepherd – which generates and evaluates
multi-item checklists – both offer more expressive signals
than binary labels but still fall short, adding marginal gains
of 0.2% and 0.5% absolute average accuracy respectively.
This shows that having continuous scores alone does not
guarantee effective test-time guidance. In contrast, PRINTS
is trained to produce multi-factor analyses and a dense com-
parative score grounded in both information-gain estimation
and pairwise preference learning. This design choice en-
ables it to identify subtle yet important quality differences
between candidate steps and select the most informative
next step, leading to better information-seeking behavior.
PRINTS improves highly performant information-
seeking agents.
In Table 2, we evaluate PRINTS on the
specialized information-seeking agent DeepResearch-30B-
A3B, specifically optimized for and achieves high perfor-
mance in long-horizon information-gain tasks through exten-
sive fine-tuning. The results show that adding PRINTS to
this strong information-seeking agent consistently achieves

performance gains across benchmarks, surpassing the base
agent by 3.9% absolute average accuracy, while no other
baselines come close to achieving notable improvements,
with the strongest one improving performance by only
1.3% absolute average accuracy.
It is also noteworthy
that PRINTS improves on the challenging subsets, such
as GAIA Level 3 and WebWalkerQA Hard. Moreover,
on GAIA, PRINTS lifts DeepResearch-30B-A3B from
61.9% to 64.4% average accuracy, enabling the 30B agent
augmented with the 4B PRM to reach competitive perfor-
mance with OpenAI DeepResearch (67.4%) and surpass
DeepSeek-V3.1-671B (63.1%).2 Specialized information-
seeking agents (Wu et al., 2025a; Li et al., 2025b;c) require
a large-scale dataset (10k-100k+ samples), substantial com-
putational costs for tool interactions and multi-step rollouts
during online reinforcement learning, which is especially
challenging as different samples have different trajectory
lengths to provide the outcome reward signal for training
agents (Gao et al., 2025). Despite these agents undergoing
resource-intensive training, applying PRINTS further im-
proves this strong information-seeking agent, surpassing its
original performance with training only a small 4B model
that either does not require a large dataset (2k+ pair samples)
or long-horizon rollouts and tool interactions during train-
ing. These findings demonstrate that even highly optimized
information-seeking agents can benefit from the step-level
guidance provided by PRINTS, pushing their performance
to the limit in a cost- and data-effective manner.
PRINTS also generalizes to frontier LLMs.
To fur-
ther demonstrate the versatility of our approach, we use
the closed-source Gemini-2.5-Flash as the LLM agent, as
shown in Table 3. PRINTS provides 4.0% absolute av-
erage accuracy gain, whereas the second-best method im-
proves performance by only 1.5%. On the most challeng-
ing subset, GAIA Level 3, PRINTS yields the largest

strength on long-horizon reasoning tasks. Overall, our re-
sults indicate that PRINTS provides effective test-time guid-
ance, improving the information-seeking behavior of both
open-source LLMs, closed-source LLMs, and information-
seeking agents, which shows strong versatility and general-
izability without modifying or retraining underlying LLMs.
4.3. Analysis and Ablations
Summarization ability contributes to better scoring
ability.
To validate the effectiveness of compressed
information-seeking trajectory representations for accurate
step-level scoring, we compare our summarization approach
against several alternatives: providing only the most recent
one, two, or four trajectory steps as input context (H−1:,
H−2:, H−4:), and providing the full trajectory Ht. We eval-
uate on Qwen3-32B across FRAMES and GAIA. Since
the performance on GAIA Level 3 is low (see Table 1),
we only use Levels 1 and 2. Results in Table 4 show that
our summary-based approach achieves the best or second-
best performance across benchmarks, outperforming the full
raw-history baseline by 7.7% absolute average accuracy.
Notably, providing more raw history does not improve per-
formance. H−2: outperforms both H−1: (insufficient con-
text), H−4:, and Ht (excessive, noisy context). This demon-
strates that accumulated raw context becomes a bottleneck
– longer histories introduce noise and irrelevant informa-
tion that hinder the PRM from identifying key information,
distracting step-level evaluation. In contrast, our summa-
rization compresses entire trajectories into compact repre-
sentations that preserve key information while filtering out
noise and maintaining bounded input length, enabling more
accurate scoring even as trajectories grow arbitrarily long.
Complementary rewards improve step-level evaluation.
We analyze the contribution of each reward component

in Equation (6). Following the setup from the previous abla-
tion, we evaluate on Qwen3-32B across FRAMES, GAIA
Levels 1, and 2. As shown in Table 5, combining the score
and comparison rewards (rs + rc) yields substantially better
performance than using either component alone, leading to
2.0% and 3.1% absolute average accuracy gains compared
to using the score reward (rs) and comparison reward (rc),
respectively. This indicates that information-gain estimation
and preference prediction capture complementary aspects of
the quality of an information-seeking trajectory step, under-
scoring the benefit of our pairwise annotation strategy over
prior work that labels individual steps in isolation (Xiong
et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024a). Furthermore, incorporating
the adaptive weight (rs+w·rc) yields 1.0% additional abso-
lute average accuracy gain over the naive combination. This
is because the adaptive weight mitigates noise in preference
pairs. Pairs with small information gain score differences
are inherently noisier, as they may reflect annotation vari-
ance rather than true quality differences. Thus, these pairs
receive lower weights, while pairs with clear margins are
weighted higher, leading to more stable learning. Overall,
adaptive weighting provides a simple and cost-efficient way
of leveraging existing annotated preference pairs.
PRINTS scales effectively with test-time compute.
In
order to evaluate how PRINTS benefits from additional test-
time compute, we conduct best-of-n scaling experiments
with varying numbers of candidate steps (n ∈{1,2,4,8,16})
on GAIA Level 2 using Qwen3-32B, as shown in Figure 4.
PRINTS exhibits strong scaling behavior, achieving 2.5%,
3.8%, 8.9% absolute accuracy gains at n = 2, 4, 8, re-
spectively, demonstrating that PRINTS reliably identifies
higher-quality steps within large candidate sets. However,
performance declines at n = 16, which we attribute to over-
exploration: we observe that the PRM increasingly selects
uncertainty-resolving steps even when correct answers al-
ready appear among candidates. Consequently, the agent
continues exploring until it reaches the maximum step bud-
get, failing to output an answer despite having generated one

earlier. In contrast, StepWiser provides only marginal and
inconsistent improvements under scaling. This difference
in scaling efficiency further validates that PRINTS’s design
of information-gain estimation and preference prediction
captures subtle quality differences between steps, enabling
fine-grained guidance for long-horizon information-seeking.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce PRINTS, a generative PRM
for long-horizon information seeking.
PRINTS unifies
information gain scoring with recursive trajectory sum-
marization, enabling fine-grained step-level evaluation un-
der rapidly accumulating context from agents. To equip
PRINTS with these dual capabilities, we develop an an-
notation pipeline that constructs preference step pairs with
information gain scores and summaries, and we jointly train
PRINTS through alternating schedule of supervised fine-
tuning for summarization and reinforcement learning for
scoring. We validate PRINTS on three distinct agents, in-
cluding a strong information-seeking agent, and compre-
hensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTS consistently
enhances the information-seeking abilities of these agents,
showcasing its high versatility. Notably, PRINTS pushes
the performance of the frontier information-seeking agents
beyond their original performance, showing that test-time
guidance can be a powerful complement to agent fine-tuning
while remaining robust to changes in underlying models.

A. Details of Experimental Setups
Tool Implementation Details.
We conduct all experi-
ments within the Inspect-Eval evaluation framework (AI Se-
curity Institute, 2024), which fully supports the ReAct
paradigm (Yao et al., 2023) for multi-turn reasoning and
tool interactions necessary for complex information-seeking
tasks. The framework provides access to a comprehensive
set of external tools:
• Web Search: We utilize the Serper search API to re-
trieve up-to-date web content for search queries.
• Web Browsing: The framework includes built-in
browser automation tools, supporting essential web
interaction functions such as browsing with URLs,
clicking, scrolling down/up, typing, etc.
12

PRINTS : Reward Modeling for Long-Horizon Information Seeking
• Code Execution: The framework also supports built-in
Python and Bash code execution environments.
In this evaluation framework, agents use these tools to inter-
act with external sources to search and synthesize informa-
tion to solve given information-seeking questions.
Evaluation Benchmarks.
We provide in-depth explana-
tions of the long-horizon information-seeking benchmarks
used in our experiments. (1) GAIA (Mialon et al., 2024)
evaluates the ability to act as a general AI assistant on com-
plex retrieval and reasoning tasks spanning three difficulty
levels. Following prior work (Li et al., 2025c; Gao et al.,
2025; Kang et al., 2025), we use 103 questions from the
text-only validation subset. (2) WebWalkerQA (Wu et al.,
2025b) focuses on web-based reasoning, requiring agents
to traverse webpages to locate target information across
three difficulty levels. We evaluate on 247 English ques-
tions. (3) FRAMES (Krishna et al., 2025) provides factual
and reasoning-intensive queries to assess both retrieval and
reasoning capabilities. We use a subset that consists of 300
samples that are randomly selected from the original dataset.
Baselines.
In this section, we provide a more detailed
explanation of the baselines.
• GenPRM-7B (Zhao et al., 2025) is a generative PRM
originally designed for mathematical reasoning. It pro-
duces Chain-of-Thought rationales with a binary verdict
(yes / no) indicating whether the current step is correct.
We follow their prompt format and ask GenPRM to verify
the correctness of a trajectory step and explain why the
step is judged correct or incorrect.
• Web-Shepherd-8B (Chae et al., 2025) generates a task-
specific checklist that decomposes a task into key subgoals
and evaluates agentic trajectories based on it. Specifically,
it assigns coarse feedback labels (Yes / No/ In progress)
for each checklist item for evaluation. We also follow
their prompt formats to generate a checklist for a given
information-seeking task and evaluate each trajectory step
relative to that checklist.
• StepWiser (Xiong et al., 2025) trains a generative PRM
using GRPO with binary rewards, where each step is la-
beled as effective or ineffective. For implementation, we
follow the Relative Effective Reward Thresholding in the
paper to re-annotate our training dataset: a step receives a
positive label if the ratio between the current and previous
mean accuracies exceeds the threshold (0.7), and a neg-
ative label otherwise. Using this binary supervision, we
train Qwen3-4B for 4 epochs to build StepWiser PRM.
• Confidence (Ghasemabadi et al., 2025; Fu et al., 2025;
Prabhudesai et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025) estimates rea-
soning quality based on the model’s certainty. Following

the confidence definition in recent work (Ghasemabadi
et al., 2025; Fu et al., 2025), we calculate confidence by
taking the negative average log-probability of the top-10
most likely tokens at each position across all generated
tokens in the reasoning step, and then averaging these
scores across all token positions. Higher scores indicate
lower uncertainty.
• Relevance (Wan et al., 2025) measures the coherence be-
tween the current step and the preceding context. Specif-
ically, it uses the Jaccard similarity between the current
step and the accumulated past steps. A higher similarity
indicates better contextual coherence.
• Verbal progress is a zero-shot baseline that assesses
progress toward the final answer by prompting Qwen3-4B
to estimate how close the current reasoning state is to
completing the task. The model is asked to output a scalar
that ranges from 1 to 5 based on the textual content of
the current step and its information-seeking trajectory. A
higher score indicates that the current reasoning state is
close to the final answer.
Train Configurations.
We train PRINTS using Qwen3-
4B with an alternating SFT-GRPO schedule over four cycles,
where each cycle consists of one SFT epoch for summariza-
tion followed by one GRPO epoch for scoring, to jointly
acquire both abilities. For the SFT stage, we use a batch
size of 128 and a learning rate of 1e-6. For the GRPO stage,
we execute N = 4 rollouts and use a batch size of 128 and
a learning rate of 1e-6. Such alternating optimization allows
the model to continuously refine its summarization ability
while simultaneously improving its scoring accuracy on rea-
soning quality. This iterative schedule ensures both modules
evolve synergistically, stabilizing training and preventing
either skill from degrading over time.
Data Annotations.
We construct our annotated data from
4,344 information-seeking questions, comprising 720 ques-
tions used to train information-seeking agents from the
Alibaba group (Wu et al., 2025a; Li et al., 2025b; Tao
et al., 2025), and 3,624 questions from the Miroverse-v0.1
13

PRINTS : Reward Modeling for Long-Horizon Information Seeking
dataset (MiroMind Data Team, 2025), a large-scale agent
dataset covering multi-hop QA, web navigation, and sci-
entific reasoning tasks. For the score annotation process,
we execute M = 8 rollouts per trajectory step to estimate
the mean accuracy and information gain score. We discard
steps that are either too easy (mt = 1) or too hard (mt = 0),
resulting in 2,294 preference pairs used for training.
As shown in Figure 5, our annotation pipeline produces
well-balanced information gain score distributions across
the full score range. This balanced distribution ensures that
PRINTS learns to estimate diverse trajectory step quality,
from harmful steps that reduce success probability to highly
effective steps that substantially advance toward the correct
answer. Moreover, the distributions of winning and losing
steps exhibit clear separation. This clear separation validates
the effectiveness of our preference pair construction and
using this as training signals for PRINTS to output dense
and comparative scores.
Frontier Model Performance.
For the performance of
frontier models on the GAIA benchmark, we follow
the reported results (OpenAI DeepResearch: 67.4% and
DeepSeek-V3.1-671B: 63.1%) in the DeepResearch-30B-
A3B paper (Li et al., 2025a) and use these reported numbers
as reference points when evaluating improvements brought
by integrating PRINTS into DeepResearch-30B-A3B.
B. Additional Experiments
PRINTS as Summarizer.
To validate our design of
jointly training scoring and summarization within a sin-
gle model, we compare PRINTS against a variant that uses
separate models for each capability. Specifically, we train a
PRM using only GRPO for scoring without SFT for sum-
marization, and pair it with Qwen3-32B – the same model
we use for summary annotation – to generate summaries at
test-time. As shown in 6, PRINTS, which is jointly trained
as both scorer and summarizer through our alternating SFT-
GRPO schedule, outperforms this separated design. This
demonstrates that the two abilities are complementary and
that our alternating training schedule enables seamless inte-
gration of these abilities. We hypothesize that this benefit
arises from positive transfer between the two objectives. As
both abilities operate on the same input (i.e., query, preced-
ing summary, latest tool response, current trajectory step),
learning to distill essential information during SFT directly
aids GRPO optimization by highlighting the most relevant
factors for quality evaluation.
Dataset Scaling
To further validate that PRINTS is a
cost-efficient way of improving information-seeking behav-
iors of agents without fine-tuning them, we conduct an
ablation study on the training dataset scaling. As shown

Dataset Scaling - GAIA Level 2 Performance
Figure 6. Dataset scaling. Experiments on the impact of dataset
scaling on GAIA Level 2 using Qwen3-32B. Training PRINTS
shows strong sample efficiency, achieving performance gain using
only 50%(∼1k samples) of our annotation data.
in Figure 6, using only 50% (i.e., ∼1k samples) of our an-
notation data still achieves 29.5 accuracy in GAIA Level 2,
surpassing the base agent approach by training a relatively
lightweight model (4B). The scaling curve saturates beyond
100%, indicating that our ∼2k preference pairs represent
a data-efficient point. This demonstrates strong sample ef-
ficiency compared to fine-tuning agents, which typically
require 10k-100k samples and expensive long-horizon roll-
outs using relatively larger models, requiring substantial
computational resources.

Instruction:
You are given a user information seeking problem. Your task is to act as an impartial judge and evaluate how well the "Current Reasoning 
Step" contributes to solving the user's problem based on the problem description and historical reasoning context. It is OK that the current 
step does not contain any tool call response.
REASONING EVALUATION RULES:
- As you evaluate, develop and refine your assessment criteria based on the specific requirements of this problem type and reasoning 
context. Think carefully about how to assess the quality of the current reasoning step. Your thinking should include your evaluation criteria, 
explaining how the step aligns with or deviates from your expectations.
- Finally, assign the reasoning step a score from -4 to 4, using either an integer or a decimal with up to 0.1 precision. A higher score should 
indicate a higher-quality response.

2. Analysis: [Always provide a step-by-step analysis here. First, briefly state the goal of the current reasoning step. Second, systematically 
evaluate the step against each of your identified criteria above. For each criterion, assess how well the step performs and explain your 
reasoning. If errors or deficiencies are found, clearly explain what is wrong and why. If the step performs well on a criterion, explain why it 
succeeds.]
3. Final Judgment: [Provide the final judgment within \\boxed_score{{}}. Examples: \\boxed_score{{-3.0}} or \\boxed_score{{3.5}}.]

PRINTS : Reward Modeling for Long-Horizon Information Seeking
Prompt Template for PRM as Summarizer
Instruction:
You are a reasoning trace summarizer for multi-step information seeking problems. Your task is to incrementally build a concise summary of 
an information-seeking process. Your summary should capture the process's state of knowledge, uncertainty, hypothesis, and next actions.
Input Sources:
# Information Seeking Problem - the original user question.
# Historical Reasoning Trace Summary - the accumulated summary built from all previous reasoning steps and tool responses.
# Previous Tool Response - the tool response from the immediately preceding step (not yet incorporated into Historical Summary).
# Current Reasoning Step - the reasoning and tool interaction from the current step (not the complete reasoning trace).
SUMMARIZATION RULES:
- Keep essential information from the Previous Tool Response and Current Reasoning Step needed for the next action.
- Incorporate what the current process believes, suspects, verifies, or is planning further verification.
- For the Current Reasoning Step's action, summarize tool name and key parameters.
- Preserve the Historical Reasoning Trace Summary unless explicitly contradicted or superseded. Justify any removals.
- Do NOT infer or invent missing information. It is normal for reasoning to be incomplete.
- Output the COMPLETE updated summary.
[Input]:
# Information Seeking Problem
{problem}
# Historical Reasoning Trace Summary
{historical_summary}
# Previous Tool Response
{previous_tool_response}
# Current Reasoning Step
{current_reasoning}
[Output format]:
1. Analysis: [In 3-5 sentences, explain what key information from Previous Tool Response and Current Reasoning Step is being added, what (if 
anything) from Historical Summary is being removed or updated and why, and why the resulting summary is sufficient for next steps.]
2. Updated Summary: [Provide the complete summary within \\boxed_summary{{}} containing:
- **Confirmed Knowledge**: Verified facts.
- **Uncertainty**: What remains unknown.
- **Previous Hypotheses**: Abandoned hypotheses (if relevant).
- **Previous Action**: Previous tool calls with key parameters in the Historical Reasoning Trace Summary.
- **Current Hypothesis**: Current working hypothesis in the Current Reasoning Step and Historical Reasoning Trace Summary.
- **Current Action**: Most recent tool call with key parameters in the Current Reasoning Step.]

Reasoning: 'Okay, let's try to figure out this question. First, I need to recall if there's any well-known song that fits this description. The mention of a 
rooster and a hamster makes me think of children's songs or maybe something from a cartoon. But I'm not immediately recalling a specific song. 
Maybe I should break it down. The key elements here are: composed a song, performed by a rooster and a hamster, separate animated videos, 
different tempos and lyrics… Since I'm stuck, maybe I should use the available tools to search for the answer. The user has provided a Google search 
function. Let me try that. I'll use the google_search function with the query: "song performed by rooster and hamster animated videos different 
tempos composer". Let's see what comes up…'

1. **Criteria Development**:  …
2. **Analysis**: 
-
**Logical Validity**: The assistant correctly identifies the problem’s key elements (rooster/hamster, animated videos, different tempos/lyrics) and 
considers plausible angles (children’s songs, educational videos, viral content). This demonstrates a structured approach.
-
**Tool Call Appropriateness**: The Google search query is specific and tailored to the problem, making it a strong tool call. The query includes all 
critical details (e.g., "rooster and hamster," "different tempos," "composer").
-
**Progress Toward Answer**: The step is progressively moving toward the answer by combining analysis with targeted research. The assistant avoids 
vague assumptions and instead focuses on actionable steps.  
-
**Confidence in Uncertainty**: The assistant acknowledges uncertainty (e.g., "I’m not immediately recalling a specific song") and uses the tool to 
resolve it, which is appropriate. 
3. **Final Judgment**: The assistant’s reasoning is well-structured, logically valid, and appropriately uses a tool call to address the problem. The step 
balances analytical thinking with practical action.

Reasoning: ‘Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. …I recall that "The Yellow Song" by The Yellow Album Leaf is a song where a rooster and a 
hamster perform the song in different animated versions. The rooster's version is faster, and the hamster's is slower. The lyrics are also slightly 
different between the two. The composer of this song is likely the same as the artist, The Yellow Album Leaf. But wait, The Yellow Album Leaf is a 
project by Ben Schneider. Let me confirm that. A quick search in my mind: yes, Ben Schneider is the creator and composer behind The Yellow 
Album Leaf. The song in question is part of their "Yellow Album" series, which includes various characters and their own versions of songs. So, the 
answer should be Ben Schneider. Let me make sure there's no other composer associated with that specific song. Since The Yellow Album Leaf is his 
project, and he composes the songs, it's safe to attribute the composition to him. Therefore, the first name is Ben and the last name is Schneider

1. **Criteria Development**:  …
2. **Analysis**: 
-
**Logical Validity**: The assistant assumes the song is "The Yellow Song" by *The Yellow Album Leaf* without confirming its existence or relevance 
to the described scenario. This leap in logic is unsupported by evidence.
-
**Evidence-Based Conclusion**: The assistant relies on unverified memory (e.g., "Ben Schneider is the creator of The Yellow Album Leaf") without 
citing any sources or references. This undermines the reliability of the answer.
-
**Relevance to Problem**: The reasoning focuses on a specific project but fails to address the core question directly. The connection between the 
described scenario and the song/composer is unclear.
-
**Confidence in Answer**: The assistant presents the answer with certainty, despite the lack of evidence. This overconfidence is problematic in an 
information-seeking context.
3. **Final Judgment**:  The reasoning step is speculative and lacks evidence, making it unsuitable for solving the problem. The conclusion is not 
justified by the provided information.

Figure 10. PRINTS step-level evaluation examples on a GAIA query. Among four candidate steps, we show the highest-scoring (top) and
lowest-scoring (bottom) steps. The high-quality step acknowledges uncertainty and initiates an appropriate tool call to gather missing
information, while the low-quality step makes unverified assumptions and confidently produces an unsupported answer without evidence.
