ABSTRACT
Accurate assessment of burn severity at injury onset remains a major
clinical challenge due to the lack of objective methods for detecting
subsurface tissue damage. This limitation is critical in battlefield
and mass-casualty settings, where rapid and reliable evaluation of
burn depth is essential for triage and surgical decision-making. We
present a multimodal optical imaging framework that establishes the
foundation for a compact, low-size, weight, and power (low-SWaP)
field-deployable device for quantitative burn assessment. The system
integrates broadband hyperspectral imaging (VSWIR, 400–2100 nm)
with laser speckle contrast imaging to jointly evaluate biochemical
composition and microvascular perfusion. Using short-wave infrared
(SWIR, >1000 nm) wavelengths, we developed and validated novel
deep-tissue parameters linked to water, lipid, and collagen absorp-
tion features that enhance burn-tissue separability and burn severity
classification. We implemented and validated unsupervised learning
methods for spectral feature extraction, band down-selection, and
clustering against histology, establishing a foundation for a rugged,
data-driven device for early quantitative burn evaluation in austere
environments.
1. INTRODUCTION
Accurate assessment of burn severity during the acute phase, 96 hours
post-injury, remains a major clinical challenge [1]. Early classifi-
cation of tissue viability is critical for resuscitation, debridement,
and surgical planning. Within this window, burn wounds undergo
complex biochemical and microvascular changes, including protein
denaturation, collagen disruption, edema formation, and progressive
ischemia that are not apparent from surface appearance alone [2].
Recent advances in optical imaging have improved the noninva-
sive evaluation of burn depth; however, no single modality provides
comprehensive biochemical and perfusion information. Ultrasound
techniques can estimate dermal thickness and edema but remain
operator-dependent and lack molecular specificity, reducing diagnos-
tic consistency [3]. Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) offers
rapid perfusion mapping but has limited depth sensitivity [4]. Spatial
Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI) quantifies absorption and scatter-
ing related to hemoglobin and water content but requires sequential
illumination, restricting real-time use and making it susceptible to
motion artifacts [5]. Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) provides label-free
biochemical contrast [6]; however, many of the existing studies mea-
sure only reflectance in the visible-near infrared (VNIR, 400 – 1000
nm) [6–8]. Extending into the shortwave infrared (SWIR, > 1000
nm) improves sensitivity to water, lipid, and collagen markers [9].

Finally, other systems use more multi-spectral systems with limited
bands that target known spectral absorbance features [10,11].
While this range of imaging modalities has been explored, their
sensitivity and specificity are limited during the early post-injury
phase, when perfusion and inflammatory dynamics evolve rapidly.
These challenges are exacerbated in conflict zones where thermobaric
and incendiary weapons produce complex burn and blast injuries that
require rapid, objective triage tools.
To address these gaps, we developed a multimodal, robotic opti-
cal system (Fig. 1) that combines point spectroscopy on a rastering
platform to iteratively build high spectral resolution hyperspectral
datacubes (VSWIR, 400–2100 nm). Our system exceeds the spec-
tral range and resolution of any previous research or commercially
available system. Collected datacubes are spatially registered with
Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) for label-free, quantitative
assessment of burn injury. We register the imaging modalities and
apply recent advances in unsupervised learning to perform automated
spectral feature extraction and tissue segmentation.
This paper contributes the following to the state-of-the-art:
• Robotic hyperspectral imaging platform for iterative datacube
acquisition across the visible-to-shortwave infrared.
• Introduction of novel deep-tissue physiological metrics derived
from shortwave infrared bands, validated through multimodal
correlation with perfusion and histological ground truth.
• Implementation of an unsupervised concrete autoencoder frame-
work for feature extraction and wavelength down-selection.

2. DATA COLLECTION
2.1. Porcine Model and Experimental Details
Burn imaging was conducted in collaboration with military clinical
partners at the Uniformed Services University (USU) using an estab-
lished animal burn model. Sexually mature male Sinclair minipigs
(Sinclair Bio Resources, Auxvasse, MO) were acclimated for at least
72 h prior to procedures. Animals were anesthetized with intramuscu-
lar tiletamine–zolazepam (Telazol, 4–8 mg/kg) and maintained under
isoflurane (1–3%) in 100% oxygen following intubation and mechan-
ical ventilation. Analgesia was provided with buprenorphine-HCl
(0.01–0.05 mg/kg IM).
Full-thickness thermal burns covering approximately 25% total
body surface area (TBSA) were created using brass contact blocks
(5×5 cm and 9×15 cm) heated to 100 ± 0.2◦C for 30 s. Anatomical
curvature introduced natural heterogeneity in burn depth, producing
regions of mixed partial- and full-thickness injury.
Multimodal imaging, including hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and
laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI), was performed on two separate
subjects: one immediately post-injury (day 0) and another seven days
post-injury to evaluate temporal changes in perfusion and biochemi-
cal composition. All procedures were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
2.2. Spectral Imaging
While previous systems have utilized HSI for burn assessment in
initial clinical studies, these devices have limited spectral resolution
and range. Towards a broader understanding of burn severity, we
utilize a point-based spectrometer to measure individual spatial points
at high spectral resolution. This present device builds on our previous
work in modeling spectra to create a sparse spectral representation
of complex surfaces [12]. A coupled fiber optic cable transmits light
from the surface into a spectrometer’s entrance slit. As the fiber
gathers light from a small discrete spatial area, we utilize a linear
x −y gantry system (Bantam Tools) to translate the perpendicular
fiber over the surface of the tissue sample.
The fiber is contained within a custom sensor pod to enable con-
sistent spectral sample acquisition. The fiber optic cable is coupled to
an uncoated VSWIR collimator (Thorlabs). Surface illumination is
provided by miniature incandescent NDIR lamps (Labsphere) through
an uncoated borosilicate plate glass diffuser. As our specimens are
measured while sedated, we must contend with thoracic excursion;
this presents the added challenge of a variable observed spot size and
illumination intensity. To compensate, the sensor pod has a miniature
time-of-flight (ToF) distance sensor that measures the distance from
the optical aperture to the specimen at 10 Hz. The pod is mounted to
a linear rail, allowing ±2 cm of adjustment on the z axis.
With knowledge of the absolute positioning of the gantry and its
encoder position, we associate an x, y position with every spectral
measurement. To form the hyperspectral datacube, a desired rectan-
gular region, with a defined width and height, is decomposed into
a series of voxel positions with a small amount of spatial overlap.
The gantry moves from position to position, pausing at each location
for the spectrometer’s integration time to allow the device to col-
lect a continuous measurement of a single surface point. The list of
observed spectra is then reshaped into a 3D hyperspectral datacube.
The robot measurement architecture is intentionally agnostic
regarding the choice of spectrometer. Our initial HSI prototype em-
ployed an ultra-high-resolution VSWIR system (ASD FieldSpec 4
Hi-Res NG , Malvern Panalytical) to capture spectral information of
the target tissue from 400 to 2500 nm. Our second study replaced the
FieldSpec with two spectrometers — VNIR (BlueWave, StellarNet,
350 – 1100 nm) and SWIR (Rock XNIR, Ibsen Photonics, 1100 –
2100 nm) — and a bifurcated fiber optic cable. Fig. 1c shows the out-
put of this iterative scanning and exemplar spectral measurements in
Fig. 1d. For simplicity and to ensure consistency across spectrometer
setups, we only consider the range of mutual spectral information in
our further modeling (400–2100 nm).
The gantry contains a dark and white reference calibration target.
The device auto-calibrates by collecting a dark measurement without
active or ambient illumination and a measurement of a white reference
target (99% Spectralon, Labsphere) before each scanning process.
The two references convert the device digital counts to reflectance
using the formulation from [12].
2.3. Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging
The Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) subsystem provides real-
time maps of microvascular perfusion by analyzing speckle contrast
dynamics generated under coherent laser illumination (λ = 785 nm)
with camera-based detection. When coherent light illuminates the
tissue surface, a random granular speckle pattern forms and fluctuates
due to the motion of scatterers, primarily red blood cells. The rate and
magnitude of these fluctuations reflect blood flow velocity, allowing
estimation of relative perfusion.
LSCI data were captured using a Moor FLPI-2 device (Moor
Instruments). Perfusion indices were computed from short-exposure
image sequences using temporal speckle contrast analysis, where the
contrast Kt is defined as the ratio of the temporal standard deviation
σt to the mean intensity ⟨It⟩across N frames. Regions with higher
flow exhibit faster fluctuations and lower contrast, while static or
poorly perfused tissue yields higher contrast. Both temporal and
spatial speckle contrast processing were explored and optimized to
balance dynamic range and sensitivity, with temporal averaging im-
proving robustness to noise and spatial filtering enhancing detection
of localized perfusion changes.
3. MODELING
3.1. Spatial and Spectral Preprocessing
Hyperspectral reflectance datacubes were preprocessed for spec-
tral consistency and multimodal alignment. HSI data were spa-
tially aligned to the corresponding white-light images using fidu-
cial markers and manual registration. LSCI images were automati-
cally registered in Fiji [13] using built-in alignment tools, followed
by manual refinement to ensure accurate correspondence with the
HSI field of view. Background masking removed non-tissue regions
and fiducials, while spectral cropping excluded noisy or redundant
bands. Wavelength-dependent smoothing corrected illumination non-
uniformity and sensor noise, producing spatially and spectrally cali-
brated datacubes.
Additional preprocessing included per-pixel L2 normalization to
mitigate illumination variability and per-band Z-score normalization
to balance spectral intensity across wavelengths, ensuring uniform
weighting in downstream analyses.
3.2. Spectral Analysis and Unsupervised Segmentation
3.2.1. Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering
Following preprocessing, unsupervised learning methods were ap-
plied to extract and cluster spectral features across the HSI dataset.
Dimensionality reduction was performed using Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to capture variance associated with biochemical and

structural alterations, followed by t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor
Embedding (t-SNE). Subsequent clustering using Gaussian Mixture
Models (GMM), cosine-similarity-based spectral grouping, and k-
means enabled delineation of tissue regions corresponding to super-
ficial, partial-thickness, and deep burn injuries without reliance on
extensive histological ground-truth.
3.2.2. Tissue Physiological Feature Extraction
Physiological parameters—including tissue oxygen saturation
(StO2) [14], Deep Tissue Water Index (DTWI), and other deep-
tissue metrics—were derived from hyperspectral absorbance data
to capture biochemical variations across burn depths. Short-wave
infrared (SWIR) bands were analyzed using spectral derivatives to
enhance sensitivity to absorption features of water, collagen, lipid,
and hemoglobin. The DTWI, defined as
DTWI =
A[1150−1230 nm]
A[1250−1350 nm]
−s2
s1 −s2
,
(1)
is the normalized ratio between water absorption bands corresponding
to an inflection point in the water absorption curve. The parameters
s1 and s2 were empirically chosen heuristics to improve robustness
under varying illumination and scattering conditions. These spectral
indices provide label-free estimates of tissue oxygenation and struc-
ture, enhancing discrimination of burn severity and tissue viability.
3.2.3. Concrete Autoencoder-based Clustering
In addition to previous unsupervised analyses of the porcine burn
dataset, a Concrete Autoencoder (CAE) [15] was implemented to per-
form differentiable feature selection and dimensionality reduction on
hyperspectral data from the second study. Given the limited availabil-
ity of histologically labeled ground truth, this approach enabled the
extraction of informative spectral features and identification of latent
clusters associated with tissue viability and burn depth. The CAE
combines a nonlinear encoder–decoder architecture with a differen-
tiable feature-selection layer that uses a Concrete (Gumbel–Softmax)
relaxation defined as:
zi =
exp((log αi + gi)/T)
P
j exp((log αj + gj)/T),
(2)
where αi denotes the learned importance weight for each spectral
band, gi represents stochastic noise that promotes exploration, and T
is a temperature parameter controlling the sharpness of selection. This
mechanism selects a discrete subset of wavelengths that preserves
key spectral information. The resulting compact embedding improves
unsupervised burn-severity clustering by emphasizing physiologically
relevant features and reducing redundancy.
Separate CAE models were trained for the StellarNet (1,502
bands) and Ibsen (255 bands) data to account for differing spectral
resolutions. Each model employed a concrete selector layer to reduce
inputs to five key bands, followed by a decoder composed of a dense
layer with five units and a reconstruction layer matching the input
size, both using LeakyReLU activations. Z-score–normalized cubes
were flattened, split into training and validation sets, and trained with
MSE loss and the Adam optimizer [16] (lr = 0.001), with the selector
temperature exponentially decaying from 10 to 0.1 over 150 epochs.
At inference, randomly reconstructed spectra from the validation
set were compared against their originals, and each scan was recon-
structed using the full autoencoder. Outputs from both autoencoders
were concatenated to restore the full spectral range. The 10 selected
bands were retained for clustering. Hyperspectral reflectance data
were L2- and Z-score-normalized, down-sampled to the selected
bands, and compared via cosine-similarity matrices. These served as
affinity matrices for spectral clustering, which embedded the affinities
and applied k-means (k = 4) to generate burn severity labels.
4. RESULTS
4.1. Spectral Characterization and SWIR Sensitivity
As shown in Figure 2, inclusion of SWIR wavelengths (>1000 nm)
markedly improved contrast between burn severities and enhanced
spectral separability across tissue types. SWIR bands captured absorp-
tion peaks that are sensitive to water and collagen content, enabling
better differentiation of viable and necrotic tissue compared to VNIR
features alone.
Spectral clustering results demonstrated that VNIR-only data
failed to resolve tissue heterogeneity within partial- and full-thickness
burn regions (Fig. 2b). Incorporating SWIR bands (Fig. 2c) improved
segmentation accuracy and clearly delineated superficial and deep
burns consistent with histological ground truth (Fig. 2a). Principal
component analysis further confirmed this improvement, with com-
bined VNIR+SWIR data (Fig. 2d–e) yielding more distinct spectral
cluster separation across burn severities.
4.2. Multimodal Perfusion and Spectral Correlation
Perfusion maps derived from temporal speckle contrast analysis re-
vealed spatial gradients corresponding to areas of reduced microvas-
cular flow, which aligned closely with HSI-derived parameters such
as StO2 and DTWI. As shown in Fig. 3, superficial burns exhibited
regions of high perfusion (low speckle contrast) that coincided with
elevated StO2 and DTWI values, reflecting preserved vascular in-
tegrity and tissue hydration. Conversely, full-thickness burns showed
markedly reduced perfusion and diminished optical absorption near

970 and 1200 nm, consistent with dehydration and collagen denatura-
tion in deep injuries.
At Day 7 post-injury, LSCI-derived perfusion maps and HSI-
derived StO2 distributions exhibited strong spatial correspondence
(Figs. 3d–f). Areas of increased flow correlated with inflammatory
response in deep and full-thickness burns, confirming the comple-
mentary sensitivity of LSCI and VNIR–SWIR HSI to vascular and
biochemical changes. Together, these results establish a robust multi-
modal framework for quantitative assessment of perfusion and tissue
viability following thermal injury.
4.3. CAE-based Feature Extraction and Clustering Analysis
Concrete autoencoders (CAE) provide a data-driven deep learning
method for selecting the 10 most representative spectral bands from
the aggregated data of the second study. The autoencoders for the
StellarNet and Ibsen spectrometer bands achieved a validation loss of
0.0138 and 0.0084, respectively, at the end of training. After training,
the autoencoders were used for inference as described in Section 3.2.3
on random validation pixels. With < 1% of the original bands, the
autoencoder effectively recreates the general features of the original
spectra, as seen in (b) and (c) in Fig. 4.
The final combined bands selected by the autoencoders were 528,
617, 762, 837, 954, 1,119, 1,324, 1,567, 1,775, and 2,005 nm. These
bands were used to downsample the spectra from the second scan in
the study, resulting in a 10-band hypercube. Next, cosine similarity
spectral clustering assigned a label to each pixel in this hypercube.
(d) in Fig. 4 shows a colorized and smoothed visualization of these
labels. Treating this as a segmentation, we can see that this approach
does well in differentiating the regions in our histology report (a) and
corresponds with our other derived biochemical parameters in Fig. 3.
5. DISCUSSION
The prototype system was developed and tested, demonstrating accu-
rate tissue perfusion mapping and burn-severity classification with
potential for field deployment. Integration of VNIR–SWIR hyper-
spectral imaging with LSCI enabled a complementary assessment of
structural, vascular and metabolic features essential for accurate burn-
depth assessment, underscoring the value of a multimodal approach.
CAE–based band selection achieved substantial spectral compression
without loss of diagnostic fidelity, supporting the development of a
compact multimodal device. In particular, the selected features in-
cluded multiple SWIR wavelengths, demonstrating improved perfor-
mance over prior literature that relied solely on VNIR bands. Future
work will expand labeled dataset with increased depth resolution and
enhance algorithms to better model fused multimodal interactions for
more robust segmentation and burn-depth classification.
6. CONCLUSION
This work introduces a multimodal VSWIR–LSCI framework that
integrates broadband hyperspectral and perfusion imaging with spec-
tral feature extraction and physiological feature mapping, providing a
quantitative, label-free approach for the early, objective assessment
of burn depth and tissue viability.
Preliminary results from porcine studies demonstrate that the in-
clusion of SWIR wavelengths significantly enhances the separability
of burn severity clustering and classification, improving the accu-
racy of label-free, unsupervised analysis. These findings establish
a strong foundation for the continued refinement of the AI-driven
VSWIR–LSCI framework and future development of a compact,
Low-SWaP, field-deployable device for real-time assessment of tissue
viability in both clinical and operational environments.
