Abstract
The UNet-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) extends the
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) by incorporating a parallel UNet pathway,
enabling the retention of both high- and low-frequency components. While
UFNO improves predictive accuracy over FNO, it inefficiently treats scalar
inputs (e.g., temperature, injection rate) as spatially distributed fields by
duplicating their values across the domain. This forces the model to pro-
cess redundant constant signals within the frequency domain. Addition-
ally, its standard loss function does not account for spatial variations in
error sensitivity, limiting performance in regions of high physical impor-
tance. We introduce UFNO-FiLM, an enhanced architecture that incor-
porates two key innovations. First, we decouple scalar inputs from spatial
features using a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, allowing
the model to modulate spatial feature maps without introducing constant
signals into the Fourier transform. Second, we employ a spatially weighted
loss function that prioritizes learning in critical regions. Our experiments
on subsurface multiphase flow demonstrate a 21% reduction in gas satu-
ration Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to UFNO, highlighting the
effectiveness of our approach in improving predictive accuracy.

Introduction
Accurate simulation of the movement of fluids in porous media underpins strate-
gies for sustainable storage & extraction [1], environmental monitoring, and con-
taminant transport [2], making these simulations indispensable in both industry
and research. Traditionally, the simulation of subsurface fluid dynamics has re-
lied on numerical solvers based on implicit formulations of partial differential
equations (PDEs) [3, 4, 5]. These solvers discretize the computational domain

into grids and apply finite difference, finite element, or finite volume methods
to approximate the governing equations.
While such methods have been successful in reproducing the evolution of
pressure, saturation, and other key variables over time, they encounter sig-
nificant challenges when applied to large, high-resolution grids. The compu-
tational burden increases dramatically with grid refinement, making real-time
decision-making and dynamic calibration (history matching) increasingly diffi-
cult in practical field applications [6].
In recent years, data-driven surrogate models have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional solvers [7, 8, 9, 10]. These models leverage machine
learning techniques to learn the underlying mappings directly from data, poten-
tially reducing the computational costs associated with high-fidelity numerical
simulations. Among these approaches, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) has
demonstrated notable advantages by learning mappings in the frequency do-
main [11]. By performing a Fourier transform on the input fields, FNO is able
to parameterize the low-frequency components of the solution, thereby achiev-
ing inherent resolution independence. However, while FNO efficiently captures
global system behaviors, it struggles to accurately reproduce high-frequency
details that are critical for modeling localized phenomena.
To overcome this limitation, the UNet-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator
(UFNO) was developed by integrating a parallel UNet branch that is specifically
designed to preserve high-frequency information [12]. This hybrid architecture
combines the strengths of both FNO and UNet to provide a more comprehensive
representation of the underlying dynamics. However, in the UFNO paper, scalar
control inputs, such as injection rates or temperature, are treated by spatially
duplicating them. This treatment forces the model to process constant signals
in the frequency domain, which is not the most effective approach as this results
in redundant computations and suboptimal learning of the underlying physics.
Moreover, often the loss function applies a uniform penalty across the spatial
domain, ignoring local variations in error sensitivity. This uniform approach
may compromise model performance in areas where even small errors carry
significant physical implications.
In our work, we introduce UFNO-FiLM, an enhanced surrogate model that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations.
First, we decouple
scalar inputs from spatial features by incorporating a Feature-wise Linear Mod-
ulation (FiLM) layer [13].
Rather than spatially duplicating scalar values,
the FiLM layer processes these inputs via a learnable module that generates
channel-specific modulation parameters.
These parameters are then used to
affine-transform the spatial feature maps, ensuring that constant scalar signals
modulate the learned frequency-domain representations effectively without di-
luting critical spatial features. Second, we adopt a spatially weighted loss func-
tion during training, which assigns greater importance to regions of the domain
that are crucial for capturing complex flow dynamics. By emphasizing errors in
these key areas, the adaptive loss strategy guides the network to produce more
accurate overall predictions.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review
2

the related work in subsurface simulation and data-driven surrogate modeling.
Section 3 details the UFNO-FiLM architecture and our proposed method. Sec-
tion 4 presents a comprehensive evaluation of our model, and Section 5 concludes
with a discussion of the results and potential directions for future research.

Related Work
Surrogate modeling for subsurface flow has attracted significant attention over
the past decades. In this section, we review prior work on both classical, physics-
based surrogate models and modern data-driven approaches.
Classical physics-based surrogate models
Traditional approaches for sim-
ulating subsurface flow rely on solving the governing nonlinear partial differ-
ential equations using techniques such as finite difference, finite element, or
finite volume methods [5].
However, the high computational cost associated
with fine-grid discretization and multiscale heterogeneity has motivated the
development of reduced-order models (ROMs).
Methods such as coarse-grid
modeling and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-based ROM reduce the
complexity by mapping full simulation trajectories into a low-dimensional space
[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. An alternative to analysing the state vectors and
reducing the complexity of the problem with proper orthogonal decomposition
methods is to simplify the physics of the problem to be solved beforehand. Ver-
tically integrated modelling [21, 22, 23, 24, 25] is a powerful tool for geological
carbon storage for general subsurface flow phenomena. While these techniques
can substantially speed up computations, they often simplify critical aspects
of the flow physics, which may lead to loss of fidelity in representing sharp
interfaces and localized heterogeneities.
Physics-informed and data-driven approaches
Recent years have wit-
nessed a surge in physics-informed machine learning methods aimed at inte-
grating data-driven approaches with physical laws. For example, Fraces et al.
[26] employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) combined with trans-
fer learning and generative techniques to tackle two-phase immiscible transport
problems. Similarly, Cai et al. [27] provide a comprehensive review of PINNs
for inverse problems in fluid mechanics, although Fuks and Tchelepi [28] point
out that PINN formulations may struggle to capture sharp saturation fronts
inherent to nonlinear subsurface flow dynamics.
Data-driven surrogate modeling
Data-driven surrogate models bypass the
need for explicit solution of the underlying PDEs by directly learning the map-
ping from input parameters (e.g., permeability distributions, injection rates) to
simulation outputs. Early approaches include the use of Gaussian processes for
history matching in unconventional reservoirs [29] and polynomial chaos expan-
sions for modeling channelized reservoirs [30]. Feed-forward neural networks
have been applied for history matching [31], while convolutional architectures
3

such as U-Net [32] and deep convolutional encoder–decoder networks [7] have
demonstrated promising results in capturing spatially distributed flow fields.
Recurrent architectures like R-U-Net [33] have further advanced the capability
to predict dynamic behaviors over multiple time steps. Recent advances in neu-
ral operators, particularly Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) [11], have shown
remarkable capabilities in learning solution operators for parametric PDEs while
maintaining resolution independence. The U-Net-enhanced Fourier Neural Op-
erator (UFNO) [12] further combines Fourier-based global modeling with U-
Net’s local feature extraction, demonstrating improved accuracy for subsurface
flow predictions.
Building on these developments, our work introduces a novel surrogate model
that integrates the strengths of Fourier-based neural operators with modern
deep learning techniques. Inspired by the success of the UNet-enhanced Fourier
Neural Operator (UFNO) in capturing global system behavior [12], we fur-
ther enhance the architecture by incorporating Feature-wise Linear Modulation
(FiLM) layers. This design decouples scalar control inputs from spatial features,
thereby reducing redundant computations and enabling more effective learning
of both global dynamics and localized high-frequency details.

Methodology
In this section, we present the methodology behind our proposed UFNO-FiLM
model, which extends the UNet-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO)
through two key innovations. First, we integrate a Feature-wise Linear Mod-
ulation (FiLM) layer to decouple scalar inputs from spatial features. Second,
we introduce a spatially weighted loss function to prioritize error reduction in
physically critical regions. Together, these modifications enable the model to
more effectively capture the underlying physical processes and enhance overall
predictive accuracy.
In the original UFNO framework, scalar inputs (e.g., temperature, injection
rate) are spatially duplicated to match the dimensionality of spatial fields, inad-
vertently forcing the network to propagate constant signals through the Fourier
layers. This results in unnecessary frequency-domain computation and can di-
lute the learning of meaningful spatial patterns. To overcome this limitation,
UFNO-FiLM incorporates a FiLM layer [13] that processes scalar inputs inde-
pendently through a small learnable module and uses the resulting modulation
parameters to condition the spatial feature maps. In addition, we introduce
a spatially weighted loss function that assigns greater importance to regions
known—based on physical insight—to be more sensitive or dynamically active.
The following subsections describe these two components in detail.
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) Layer
The FiLM layer is a mechanism originally introduced to perform feature-wise
affine transformations on neural activations [13]. In our UFNO-FiLM model,
4

the FiLM layer serves the purpose of integrating scalar inputs into the network
without compromising the inherent spatial characteristics learned by the main
UFNO branch, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Let us denote the spatial feature maps extracted from the UFNO branch as
F ∈RH×W ×C, where H and W are the height and width of the feature maps,
and C is the number of channels. Each channel represents a distinct feature
extracted by the network, encoding different spatial patterns or activations. The
scalar inputs, represented by a vector s ∈Rd (where d is the number of scalar
features), are processed through a learnable transformation g that produces
modulation parameters:
(γ, β) = g(s),
γ, β ∈RC.
Here, g : Rd →RC is implemented as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and
optimized jointly with the rest of the network. The role of the FiLM layer is to
modulate each channel of the spatial features using the parameters γ and β via
a channel-wise affine transformation:
eFi,j,c = γc · Fi,j,c + βc,
∀i ∈{1, . . . , H}, j ∈{1, . . . , W}, c ∈{1, . . . , C}.
This operation effectively scales and shifts the spatial features according to
the scalar input information. By isolating the scalar inputs from the Fourier do-
main transformations, the FiLM layer prevents constant signals (which have no
spatial variation) from unnecessarily influencing the learned frequency represen-
tations. Instead, these inputs modulate the network’s activations in a controlled
manner, enhancing the network’s expressiveness and capacity to model complex
spatial-temporal dynamics.

Spatially Weighted Loss Function
A critical challenge in training neural operators for physical simulations is en-
suring that the model pays adequate attention to regions of the domain that are
5

of higher physical importance. In conventional loss functions, such as the Mean
Squared Error (MSE), each spatial location contributes equally to the overall er-
ror, which may not be ideal when certain areas exhibit more significant physical
variations or are more critical for the overall system performance.
To address this issue, we propose a spatially weighted loss function. For a
given sample n, let yn(i, j) denote the ground truth at spatial location (i, j) and
byn(i, j) denote the corresponding prediction. We assign a weight w(i, j) to each
spatial location, where the weights are determined by prior domain knowledge.
The spatially weighted MSE loss is then defined as:
LSW = 1
N
N
X
n=1
H
X
i=1
W
X
j=1
w(i, j) (yn(i, j) −byn(i, j))2 ,
where N is the total number of training samples. The weighting function w(i, j)
is designed to assign higher values to regions where accurate predictions are
critical (e.g., areas with steep gradients or significant physical transitions) and
lower values to regions where errors are less consequential.
In practice, the weight map w can be derived from a variety of sources. For
example, if physical simulations indicate that certain spatial regions are associ-
ated with higher fluxes or stress concentrations, these regions can be manually
assigned higher weights. Alternatively, an adaptive weighting strategy can be
implemented where the weights are iteratively updated based on the model’s
performance during training. In our experiments, the weight map w is com-
puted as the per-pixel mean of the training images, which captures the statistical
distribution of plume migration across the dataset. This approach emphasizes
the regions where plume migration is most prominent, ensuring that these crit-
ical areas are assigned higher importance during model training. The resulting
weight map is then fixed and applied uniformly to all training samples.

Experiments and Results
In this section, we present a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed UFNO-
FiLM model on the subsurface simulation dataset used in [12].
In this section, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed
UFNO-FiLM model using the benchmark multiphase-flow dataset introduced
in the original UFNO studies [12].
We compare UFNO-FiLM against base-
line models across multiple metrics and scenarios to demonstrate the impact of
FiLM-based conditioning and spatially weighted loss on predictive accuracy.
Dataset Description
We evaluate our model using the same dataset intro-
duced in the original UFNO work [12]. The dataset consists of 5000 numerical
simulations of two-phase (CO2–water) flow in a radially symmetric reservoir,
generated using the ECLIPSE E300 compositional simulator. Each simulation
models 30 years of CO2 injection under varying geological and operational con-
ditions, including heterogeneous permeability and porosity fields, anisotropy
6

ratios, multiple injection rates, and reservoir thicknesses ranging from 12 m to
200 m. For each realization, the dataset provides 24 temporal snapshots of the
evolving gas saturation and pressure buildup fields defined on a two-dimensional
radial grid.
Following the experimental protocol of [12], the dataset is divided into 4000
samples for training, 500 for validation, and 500 for testing. Consistent with the
preprocessing in the UFNO framework, gas saturation fields are kept in their
physical range [0, 1], whereas the pressure buildup fields are standardized to zero
mean and unit variance prior to training. In addition, each simulation includes
an active-cell mask that identifies valid reservoir regions; all loss computations
are performed only over these active cells, ensuring that padded or inactive
regions do not contribute to the error.
The original UFNO loss formulation employs a relative Lp loss applied both
to the field values and to their first radial derivatives, which helps capture sharp
saturation fronts and pressure gradients near the injection well. Because our
work focuses on modeling gas saturation evolution rather than pressure tran-
sients, we do not include pressure-field predictions in our main results. Nonethe-
less, we follow the same normalization and masking strategy for consistency and
comparability with prior work.
Training and Validation Curves.
Figures 2a and 2b show the training and
validation loss trajectories for the Attention UNet, FNO, UFNO, and UFNO-
FiLM models. All models exhibit stable convergence during training, with their
losses decreasing monotonically over the optimization epochs. While UFNO-
FiLM displays a training-loss trend comparable to that of UFNO, it achieves the
lowest validation error among all models. This superior validation performance
indicates that the FiLM-based conditioning and spatially weighted loss enhance
the model’s generalization capabilities and mitigate overfitting relative to the
baseline architectures.

Performance at different injection times.
Figure 3 presents a comparison
of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Structural Similarity Index Measure
(SSIM) computed between the predictions and ground truth at various injection
times. The left subfigure shows the MAE comparison for FNO, UFNO, and
UFNO-FiLM, where UFNO-FiLM consistently achieves lower error values. The
right subfigure displays the SSIM comparison, where higher SSIM values for
UFNO-FiLM indicate improved preservation of spatial structures. Together,
these results demonstrate that incorporating the FiLM layer into the UFNO
framework enhances predictive accuracy and enhances the model’s ability to
reproduce fine-scale spatial features.

Figures 4 and 5 provide a vi-
sual overview of model predictions across different injection times. Both figures
are organized into five rows representing, from top to bottom: the ground truth,
UFNO prediction, UFNO error, UFNO-FiLM prediction, and UFNO-FiLM er-
ror. In these figures, the error maps clearly illustrate that the UFNO-FiLM
model consistently reduces spatial errors compared to the standard UFNO ap-
proach.

show that UFNO-FiLM consistently produces lower-magnitude and more spa-
tially localized errors, indicating a clearer recovery of plume morphology and
improved fidelity relative to UFNO.

the validation set. Our results indicate that the incorporation of the FiLM layer

and spatially weighted loss function yields consistent improvements across all
metrics. In particular, the combination of the FiLM layer with the weighted loss
(UFNO-FiLM & WLoss) achieves the best MAE (0.0022) and SSIM (0.9904),
while the UFNO-FiLM model alone attains the lowest Relative Error (0.1451).
These improvements highlight the effectiveness of decoupling scalar inputs from
spatial features and adopting a loss function that accounts for local error sensi-
tivity.
Table 1 summarizes the validation performance of all models. The results
show that both components of our approach, the FiLM-based conditioning and
the spatially weighted loss, contribute to consistent improvements across the
evaluated metrics. The combined model (UFNO-FiLM & WLoss) attains the
lowest MAE (0.0022) and second best SSIM (0.9904), while UFNO-FiLM alone
achieves the lowest relative error (0.1451). These findings demonstrate the ben-
efit of decoupling scalar inputs from spatial features and incorporating spatially
informed weighting to better capture localized flow dynamics.

Training and validation performance with 10% data
Figure 6 present
the training and validation loss curves for models trained using only 10% of the
available data. The validation performance highlights a notable advantage of
the UFNO-FiLM model, which achieves the lowest validation error among all
models. This suggests that the FiLM-based adaptation enhances the model’s
generalization capabilities when data availability is limited. The improved per-
formance in this data-scarce regime indicates that UFNO-FiLM can effectively
capture relevant patterns with fewer training examples, making it a promising
approach for scenarios where acquiring large-scale training data is challenging.

Pressure build-up results
Figure 7 shows the relative loss for UFNO and
UFNO-FiLM on the training and validation sets for the pressure buildup pre-

diction task. In contrast to the saturation experiments, UFNO achieves lower
losses than UFNO-FiLM on both sets, indicating a more efficient fit to the
pressure data. The gap in validation performance, however, remains relatively
small, suggesting that although FiLM does not provide a clear advantage in
this setting, it also does not substantially degrade predictive capability. One
possible explanation for this behavior is that pressure fields exhibit smoother
spatial variations and stronger global coupling than saturation fields. Because
the FiLM mechanism primarily modulates channel-wise spatial features using
scalar inputs, it may offer limited benefit when scalar and spatial components
are already tightly correlated, as is the case for pressure buildup. Additionally,
the spatially weighted loss emphasizes regions with strong saturation dynamics,
which may not align with the comparatively diffuse structure of pressure fields,
leading to less effective learning for this target variable.

Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced UFNO-FiLM, a surrogate modeling framework
that extends the UNet Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) through two principal
enhancements: a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer and a spatially
weighted loss function. The FiLM layer decouples scalar inputs from spatial fea-
tures, enabling more expressive and physically meaningful modulation of feature
maps while avoiding the redundant transformation of constant signals into the
frequency domain. The spatially weighted loss further guides the model to pri-
oritize regions of greater physical relevance, improving its ability to capture
complex flow patterns.
Our experimental results demonstrate that UFNO-FiLM achieves consistent
improvements over existing neural-operator baselines, including a 21% reduction
in validation error relative to UFNO. These gains are reflected across multiple
metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Structural Similarity Index Measure
(SSIM), and Relative Error, s well as in qualitative error visualizations. The
11

findings highlight the value of incorporating FiLM-based conditioning and spa-
tially informed weighting into operator-learning architectures for subsurface flow
prediction. While the method shows clear gains for gas saturation, its benefits
did not extend to the smoother pressure fields in this setup, suggesting the
method is most impactful for problems with high-frequency spatial dynamics
Future work will explore extending these components to more complex multi-
phase systems, three-dimensional domains, and large-scale reservoir simulation
settings.
