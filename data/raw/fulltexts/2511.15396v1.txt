Contributions of ShelfOcc. We propose a shift in supervision strategy for weakly/shelf-supervised occupancy estimation.
Unlike prior 2D rendering-based approaches, which are prone to depth bleeding, ShelfOcc trains occupancy networks directly in native
3D voxel space with pseudo-labels generated using a combination of geometric and semantic FMs. By accumulating and filtering static
geometry while handling dynamic objects separately, our approach yields clean and consistent 3D supervision relying only on images,
without LiDAR. This shift in supervision leads to a significant performance gain over previous methods, as illustrated on the right.
Abstract
Recent progress in self- and weakly supervised occupancy
estimation has largely relied on 2D projection or rendering-
based supervision, which suffers from geometric incon-
sistencies and severe depth bleeding.
We thus introduce
ShelfOcc, a vision-only method that overcomes these lim-
itations without relying on LiDAR. ShelfOcc brings super-
vision into native 3D space by generating metrically consis-
tent semantic voxel labels from video, enabling true 3D su-
pervision without any additional sensors or manual 3D an-
notations. While recent vision-based 3D geometry founda-
tion models provide a promising source of prior knowledge,
they do not work out of the box as a prediction due to sparse
or noisy and inconsistent geometry, especially in dynamic
driving scenes. Our method introduces a dedicated frame-
work that mitigates these issues by filtering and accumu-
lating static geometry consistently across frames, handling
dynamic content and propagating semantic information into
a stable voxel representation. This data-centric shift in su-
pervision for weakly/shelf-supervised occupancy estimation
allows the use of essentially any SOTA occupancy model ar-
chitecture without relying on LiDAR data. We argue that
such high-quality supervision is essential for robust occu-
pancy learning and constitutes an important complemen-
tary avenue to architectural innovation. On the Occ3D-
nuScenes benchmark, ShelfOcc substantially outperforms
all previous weakly/shelf-supervised methods (up to a 34%
relative improvement), establishing a new data-driven di-
rection for LiDAR-free 3D scene understanding.
1. Introduction
Accurate and efficient 3D occupancy estimation is funda-
mental for safe and reliable autonomous driving, providing
a dense understanding of the environment which is crucial
for planning and navigation [46, 63]. While significant ad-

vancements have been made, many state-of-the-art methods
still depend heavily on dense 3D ground truth annotations
derived from LiDAR sensors. This dependency is a ma-
jor bottleneck for scalability and real-world application, as
manual dense 3D annotation is extremely costly and labor-
intensive [54]. Moreover, fleet vehicles are rarely equipped
with such reference sensors, preventing their data from be-
ing utilized for supervised training.
To overcome the challenges of 3D label acquisi-
tion, researchers have explored weakly/shelf-supervised ap-
proaches, often relying on 2D annotations or photomet-
ric losses through differentiable rendering.
We use the
term shelf-supervised [27, 66] to denote a form of self-
supervision that relies on off-the-shelf foundation models as
sources of geometric and/or semantic priors. Methods like
SelfOcc [20], OccNeRF [71], and GaussianFlowOcc [2] uti-
lize techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [41]
or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [26] to render 3D scene
representations back to 2D image space. This enables su-
pervision from easily obtainable 2D cues, such as seman-
tic segmentation masks produced by models like Ground-
edSAM [45] and monocular depth maps from, e.g., Met-
ric3D [68]. However, a critical limitation persists: learning
complex 3D geometry solely from 2D image-based losses is
inherently difficult. This frequently results in artifacts such
as depth bleeding, where models fail to precisely capture
the volumetric extent of objects along viewing rays, since
2D signals primarily provide information about the visible
object boundary. To provide more complete 3D supervi-
sion, rendering-based approaches rely on temporal consis-
tency, which requires handling dynamic objects and further
complicates the training while reducing but not removing
the issue of depth bleeding. These ambiguities limit perfor-
mance compared to methods with direct 3D supervision.
The growing availability of off-the-shelf 3D vision
foundation models (FMs) has opened new opportunities
for leveraging pretrained geometric priors in downstream
perception tasks.
Models such as the Visual Geome-
try Grounded Transformer (VGGT) [59] and MapAny-
thing [25] can infer detailed 3D scene attributes from im-
ages, making them appealing sources of supervision for
3D occupancy learning. Trained on vast amounts of 3D-
annotated data, these FMs can infer camera parameters,
depth maps, and dense 3D point clouds from multiple im-
ages in a single forward pass. However, as illustrated in
Fig. 1, directly applying such FMs, which typically assume
static scenes and consistent camera parameters, to dynamic
multi-camera driving sequences poses several challenges.
These include handling non-static elements and integrat-
ing semantic information into 3D space. A na¨ıve frame-
wise application (Fig. 1 Version 1) of FMs produces sparse
and incomplete labels, while simple temporal aggregation
(Fig. 1 Version 2) leads to model violations which manifest
themselves in dynamic object trails and ghosting artifacts.
In this paper, we propose ShelfOcc, a shelf-supervised
learning framework that leverages 3D geometry FMs to
generate high-quality 3D pseudo-labels and train high-
performing occupancy networks. Our proposed 3D pseudo-
label generation pipeline separates dynamic and static scene
parts, filters noisy and wrong predictions, accumulates the
static scene across the sequence and re-introduces dynamic
objects per frame. ShelfOcc offers a plug-and-play solu-
tion for supervising any occupancy network with 3D la-
bels, solely from camera images.
Our central hypothe-
sis is that direct 3D supervision, even when derived from
FM-generated pseudo-labels, can substantially enhance the
geometric understanding of occupancy networks, yielding
superior performance compared to 2D-supervised counter-
parts, without requiring costly 3D annotations. Owing to its
modular design, ShelfOcc can be seamlessly integrated into
existing occupancy prediction pipelines, providing a scal-
able framework for 3D supervision and enabling LiDAR-
free training of state-of-the-art occupancy architectures. We
demonstrate that enhancing the supervision signal can lead
to substantial gains in occupancy estimation without modi-
fying the network design itself.
In summary our contributions are as follows:
• Paradigm shift for shelf-supervised occupancy estima-
tion.
We introduce ShelfOcc, a novel framework that
enables direct and native 3D shelf-supervision for occu-
pancy estimation by leveraging the emergent capabilities
of off-the-shelf geometric and semantic foundation mod-
els, eliminating the need for LiDAR, manual 3D annota-
tions or 2D rendering supervision.
• Vision-only 3D pseudo-label generation. We develop
a sophisticated, semantics-aware pipeline that separates
static and dynamic scene components, accumulates static
geometry across time, reintroduces dynamic objects per
frame, and filters low-confidence predictions to produce
clean and consistent 3D voxel pseudo-labels.
• Data-centric performance gains. We empirically show
that our enhanced 3D supervision signal yields substantial
performance improvements, surpassing all prior shelf-
supervised methods on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark
(up to a 34% relative improvement). Importantly, these
gains are consistently observed across multiple plug-and-
play occupancy network architectures.
2. Related Work
2.1. 3D Occupancy Estimation
The 3D semantic occupancy estimation task has gar-
nered significant attention in autonomous driving research.
Broadly, vision-based approaches can be categorized into
fully supervised and shelf-supervised methods.
Fully Supervised Methods leverage dense 3D ground
2

truth annotations, typically derived from LiDAR sensors
with additional manual labeling. Most approaches adapt ar-
chitectures originally developed for object detection, lift-
ing multi-view camera features into a 3D voxel grid, re-
fining them through 3D convolutions or deformable at-
tention, and applying losses directly in voxel space [5,
18, 21, 32, 56].
Recent advancements have improved
the model efficiency [35, 38, 47, 53, 58, 69], optimized
training procedures [1, 12, 16, 22, 43, 50], or improved
the overall occupancy estimation performance through re-
fined architectural designs and specific modeling strate-
gies [7, 8, 23, 33, 34, 39, 40, 51, 67, 73, 74]. A growing
research direction explores the integration of 3D occupancy
with feature spaces of foundation models.
Some meth-
ods align predicted voxel features with vision-language rep-
resentations to enable open-vocabulary occupancy estima-
tion [3, 31, 52, 57, 70, 75], while [24, 48] distill DINO fea-
tures to obtain strong semantic priors.
Shelf-Supervised Methods, on the other hand, aim to
mitigate the reliance on expensive 3D labels by utilizing
2D annotations or self-supervision. SelfOcc [20] and Oc-
cNeRF [71] employ volume rendering techniques to project
estimated 3D occupancy into 2D image space, where photo-
metric and semantic losses from pretrained models [45, 72]
provide supervision. GaussianOcc [13] and GaussTR [24]
instead use 3D Gaussian Splatting for rendering supervi-
sion. GaussianFlowOcc [2] further models scene dynamics
to mitigate temporal inconsistencies during training. While
these shelf-supervised methods remove the need for 3D
ground truth, they struggle with precise geometric under-
standing due to the inherent ambiguity of 2D signals and
often face challenges in dynamic scenes. GS-Occ3D [65]
recently demonstrated direct 3D Gaussian optimization for
occupancy reconstruction, yet without incorporating se-
mantic labels. LeAP [14] proposes a voxel pseudo-label
pipeline for occupancy estimation using LiDAR scans as
geometric priors. The concurrent work and preprint Easy-
Occ [15] instead lifts 2D semantic segmentation masks into
3D using (only) monocular depth estimates, but does not
achieve a notable performance improvement over previous
work. It is important to note that some methods, such as
AGO [31], AutoOcc [78], and VEON [75], while not us-
ing semantic 3D annotations for training, still utilize LiDAR
data for geometric supervision, which sets them apart from
the purely vision-based, shelf-supervised paradigm we fo-
cus on. Although these methods are not directly compa-
rable to ours, we include a quantitative comparison in the
supplement for completeness. Furthermore, some research
is moving towards 4D occupancy and motion prediction,
and even world models, incorporating occupancy for future
state prediction [10, 39, 60, 76]. Finally, there is consider-
able amount of work on 4D scene reconstruction for driving
scenes, enabling tasks like novel view synthesis, scene edit-
ing and simulation [19, 37, 49, 62, 64].
2.2. Vision Foundation Models
The rapid progress of deep learning has led to the emer-
gence of powerful Vision Foundation Models (VFMs),
which have transformed a wide range of computer vi-
sion tasks. Models such as DINO [6, 42] and CLIP [44]
are trained on large-scale image corpora to learn general-
purpose visual representations.
In parallel,
Vision-
Language Models (VLMs) combine visual perception with
natural language understanding. Grounding DINO [36] and
Detic [77] are prominent examples of open-vocabulary ob-
ject detectors capable of localizing objects based on arbi-
trary text prompts. GroundedSAM [45] extends this con-
cept by integrating Grounding DINO with the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) [28], enabling open-vocabulary
segmentation by generating pixel-accurate masks for any
textual query without additional training.
Text4Seg [29]
further leverages multi-modal language models to enhance
open-vocabulary segmentation capabilities.
Recently Geometry Foundation Models emerged, which
specialize in inferring 3D geometric information from 2D
images.
Models such as DUST3R [61], MAST3R [30],
VGGT [59], and MapAnything [25] are trained on large-
scale datasets with 3D supervision (e.g., structure-from-
motion data, synthetic scenes) and can estimate depth, cam-
era poses, and dense 3D point clouds. MapAnything [25],
in particular, is designed for large-scale scene reconstruc-
tion and can leverage known camera parameters, making it
highly suitable for autonomous driving applications. These
models provide a powerful source of metrically consistent
3D geometry from standard camera inputs, which is foun-
dational to our approach for generating 3D pseudo-labels.
3. Methodology
Our proposed ShelfOcc framework generates high-fidelity,
metrically-scaled 3D semantic voxel pseudo-labels from
multi-view image sequences. These pseudo-labels act as a
plug-and-play source of supervision for any occupancy es-
timation network that leverages 3D labels. The framework
is specifically designed to overcome the limitations of di-
rectly applying 3D geometry foundation models (FMs) to
dynamic scenes.
The overall framework is illustrated in Fig. 2. We lever-
age the 3D geometry model MapAnything [25] and the
2D semantic segmentation model GroundedSAM [45] to
construct semantics-aware 3D pseudo-labels. The frame-
work comprises six key stages: 2D semantic segmentation
mask prediction, initial 3D geometry estimation and filter-
ing, static scene accumulation, dynamic object reintroduc-
tion, voxelization with visibility mask generation, and train-
ing an occupancy network using the generated labels. We
describe each stage in detail in the following subsections.

Figure 2. Overview of the ShelfOcc framework. We leverage a 3D geometry foundation model (MapAnything [25]) and a 2D semantic
foundation model (GroundedSAM [45]) to construct precise 3D semantic voxel pseudo-labels. The pipeline processes image sequences,
segregating static and dynamic scene elements, filtering and aggregating static elements and carefully reintroducing dynamic objects to
mitigate artifacts. These generated 3D pseudo-labels serve as a plug-and-play supervision for any 3D occupancy network.
3.1. Notation
We denote the dataset as a collection of driving sequences
S = {S1, S2, . . . , SN}, where each sequence Sk repre-
sents a short temporal segment composed of multiple con-
secutive frames. Formally, a sequence Sk contains Fk =
{f1, f2, . . . , fTk}, where Tk is the total number of frames
in sequence Sk. Pseudo-label generation is performed in-
dependently for each sequence.
At a given time step t,
the frame ft consists of a set of multi-view images It =
{I1,t, I2,t, . . . , IC,t}, where C denotes the total number of
cameras. Each image Ii,t is associated with its intrinsic cal-
ibration matrix Ki,t and extrinsic camera pose Ti,t, which
together define the projection from 3D world coordinates to
the 2D image plane and vice versa.
3.2. 2D Pseudo-Semantic Masks
The initial step in the ShelfOcc pipeline involves generat-
ing dense 2D pseudo-semantic segmentation masks for all
input images Ii within the sequence. We employ Ground-
edSAM [45], which combines an open-vocabulary object
detector and a highly capable segmentation model. The pro-
cess unfolds in two distinct stages. Firstly, each image is fed
into Grounding DINO [36], an open-vocabulary object de-
tection method, along with a set of text prompts correspond-
ing to the target semantic classes. The predicted bounding
boxes then serve as input prompts for SAM (Segment Any-
thing Model) [28], which then generates precise 2D masks,
inheriting the label from its corresponding predicted box.
Mitigating False Negatives / Positives via sky ground-
ing.
We observed that querying Grounding DINO for all
target classes simultaneously often results in too few de-
tections, causing many objects in the image to be missed.
However, querying the model for each class individually
can lead to a bias towards detecting objects even when they
are not present, resulting in high-confidence but incorrect
boxes and frequent class confusions. To address this is-
sue, we input each class prompt individually into Ground-
ing DINO, together with a generic background label (e.g.,
‘sky’). This strategy greatly reduces false positives by pro-
viding Grounding DINO an alternative high-confidence pre-
diction when the query object is absent. Any boxes pre-
dicted with the background label are discarded before the
second stage with SAM. The full vocabulary used for gen-
erating the semantic segmentation masks can be found in
the supplementary material. These dense 2D masks are cru-
cial for assigning semantic information to the 3D points and
for dynamically identifying objects within the scene, a crit-
ical step detailed in Sec. 3.3.
3.3. 3D Geometry Estimation and Static/Dynamic
Separation
We process the entire multi-view image sequence (across all
cameras C and time steps T) through a 3D geometry foun-
dation model. For this work, we specifically leverage Ma-
pAnything [25]. MapAnything is particularly suitable be-
cause, unlike some other FMs, it can optionally take avail-
4

able camera poses (intrinsics Ki and extrinsics Ti) as in-
put, which are readily available from autonomous driving
datasets like nuScenes [4]. This enables MapAnything to
directly predict metrically-scaled depth maps Di for each
input image Ii. The depth maps can be unprojected using
the camera poses and intrinsics to create a 3D point cloud
representing the scene geometry. One of the primary chal-
lenges in generating accurate 3D pseudo-labels for dynamic
driving scenes is the handling of moving objects. Naively
accumulating points from all time steps of the sequence into
a single 3D scene would result in moving objects appear-
ing multiple times along their trajectory, polluting the scene
representation. To prevent this, we separate the scene into
static and a dynamic components.
Static Scene Construction.
To construct the static part of
the scene, which remains consistent across all time steps
within a sequence, we first use the 2D pseudo-semantic
masks from Sec. 3.2 to determine which pixels belong to
dynamic objects. We then unproject only those pixels that
are not identified as dynamic into 3D points. This selec-
tive unprojection prevents motion artifacts, which are com-
mon because FMs like MapAnything are primarily trained
on static scenarios. The 3D coordinate P(u, v) for a pixel
(u, v) in image Ii are obtained by:
P(u, v) = Ti ·

K−1
i
·


u
v
1

· Di(u, v)

.
(1)
Here, Di(u, v) is the depth predicted by MapAnything, Ki
represents the camera intrinsics, and Ti are the camera ex-
trinsics. All static points, collected from all cameras and
time steps within a given sequence, are then aggregated into
a single global static point cloud Pstatic.
Confidence Filtering.
To mitigate noise in the accumu-
lated static point cloud and suppress spurious occupied vox-
els in the final 3D volume, we apply two confidence filtering
strategies. First, we remove points likely resulting from er-
roneous depth predictions by retaining only those that are
confirmed by multiple frames within the sequence. Con-
cretely, for each pixel ray, we record how often it traverses
a given voxel cell and how often it terminates within that
cell based on the unprojected depth points. Points located
in cells that are intersected more frequently than they are
confirmed are discarded, as they likely correspond to incor-
rect depth estimates. Second, we prune voxels with insuf-
ficient point density (fewer than four points in our case),
as such sparsely populated regions tend to represent unre-
liable or noisy predictions. Together, these filtering steps
substantially improve the consistency and reliability of the
generated point cloud, preserving only high-confidence ge-
ometric information for subsequent voxelization.
Dynamic Scene Construction.
For each time step t in
the sequence, we generate a dedicated dynamic point cloud
Pdynamic,t. This is achieved by unprojecting all pixels that
were identified as dynamic by the 2D semantic segmenta-
tion in all cameras Ii,t at that time step using Eq. (1). This
ensures that dynamic objects are captured precisely at their
positions in each frame.
3.4. Voxelization and Visibility Mask Generation
The final 3D semantic point cloud for any given frame t is
then constructed by combining the global static point cloud
with the dynamic point cloud specific to that time step. The
final step in the ShelfOcc pipeline converts the 3D semantic
point clouds Pt into high-fidelity, metrically-scaled 3D se-
mantic voxel labels, which are ready for direct supervision.
Voxelization.
A target voxel grid is first defined with
specific dimensions and resolution (e.g., [−40m, 40m] in
X/Y and [−1m, 5.4m] in Z with a 0.4m resolution for
nuScenes). For each voxel v in this grid, we aggregate all
3D points from Pt that fall within its spatial bounds. The
semantic label of v is then determined by a majority vot-
ing scheme among these collected points. To mitigate class
imbalance effects near the ground where frequent classes
(road or terrain) tend to dominate, we prioritize minority
object classes (e.g., traffic cones). If no points fall within a
voxel, it is marked as empty. This process yields a dense 3D
semantic voxel grid Vt for each frame in the sequence Si.
Camera Visibility Mask.
To effectively train an occu-
pancy network, it is essential to distinguish between truly
empty space and regions that are merely unobserved by the
cameras. For each frame t, we generate a camera visibil-
ity mask Mvis,t. This is achieved by casting rays from each
ground truth camera position through the scene. For each
ray, we identify the first occupied voxel. All voxels along
the ray before this first occupied voxel are marked as ’visi-
ble free space’. Conversely, voxels that lie behind occupied
voxels or are entirely outside the frustum of any camera are
marked as ’unobserved’. This visibility mask Mvis,t is crit-
ical during network training, as it guides the loss computa-
tion, ensuring that the model is only penalized for incorrect
predictions within regions theoretically observable by the
cameras. This accurate voxelization process ultimately pro-
vides high-quality, dense 3D semantic voxel grids Vt and
corresponding visibility masks Mvis,t.
3.5. Training with ShelfOcc Labels
The central advantage of ShelfOcc is its modular design, en-
abling seamless integration across different occupancy pre-
diction algorithms. Any existing occupancy network archi-
tecture that uses 3D voxel labels for supervision can be di-
rectly trained using ShelfOcc labels. This circumvents the

need for complex differentiable rendering pipelines that are
typically employed in 2D-supervised methods.
An occupancy network takes multi-view images as input
and predicts a dense 3D semantic voxel grid ˆVt, represent-
ing semantic probabilities for each voxel. This output is
directly compared with the generated ShelfOcc labels Vt
using loss functions like the cross-entropy loss
L =
X
t
X
v∈Vt
Mvis,t(v) · LCE( ˆVt(v), Vt(v)),
(2)
however the exact loss functions used depends on the model
of choice. The camera visibility mask Mvis,t(v) is usually
applied as a weighting factor in the loss computation. This
ensures that the loss is computed only for voxels within ob-
servable regions of the scene.
This direct 3D supervision offers two key advantages:
First, it significantly enhances 3D geometric understanding
by allowing the network to learn directly from explicit 3D
targets, effectively mitigating issues such as depth bleed-
ing and promoting a more complete and accurate geometric
representation. Second, it simplifies the training pipeline by
eliminating the need for complex differentiable rendering
mechanisms, thereby reducing memory consumption and
computational overhead.
4. Experiments
4.1. Dataset
We conduct our experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes
benchmark [55], which builds upon the widely used
nuScenes dataset [4, 11] and provides 3D semantic occu-
pancy ground truth for all scenes in the dataset (that we
only use during validation). Following standard protocol,
we evaluate model performance using the Intersection-over-
Union (IoU) across a predefined set of semantic classes,
with the mIoU being the mean over all classes. In addition,
we report the geometric IoU, which measures the voxel-
wise accuracy of occupied versus free space regardless of
the underlying semantic category, providing a measure of
geometric fidelity. To further assess consistency along the
depth axis, we also report the RayIoU metric [35], a ray-
based evaluation that mitigates inconsistencies in traditional
voxel-level IoU by comparing occupancy predictions along
camera rays.
4.2. Experimental Setup
We focus on the shelf-supervised setting, where models
are trained using only multi-view camera inputs without
access to LiDAR data or any 3D annotations from the
target dataset.
To assess the quality and generality of
our generated 3D pseudo-labels, we train several state-of-
the-art occupancy networks originally designed for fully
supervised training, namely COTR [40], CVT-Occ [67],
and STCOcc [34], directly on our generated pseudo-labels.
This enables direct comparison to previous shelf-supervised
methods while leveraging the advantages of established 3D
architectures. All models are trained with input images at
a resolution of 256 × 704, using a ResNet-50 [17] back-
bone pretrained on ImageNet [9]. Source code will be made
available after publication.
4.3. Main Results
As summarized in Tab. 1, our method establishes new
state-of-the-art results across all evaluated architectures in
the shelf-supervised occupancy estimation setting. Models
trained on our ShelfOcc pseudo-labels consistently outper-
form prior approaches, achieving improvements of up to
+5.79 mIoU and +9.23 geometric IoU over the previous
best-performing method, GaussianFlowOcc [2]. This cor-
responds to relative gains of 34% in mIoU and 20% in geo-
metric IoU. We believe the strong performance stems from
our direct 3D supervision strategy. High-quality pseudo-
labels enable occupancy networks to be trained natively in
3D space, avoiding the instability and ambiguity associ-
ated with 2D rendering-based supervision. The inherently
multi-view consistent geometric predictions from MapAny-

thing [25] provide metrically accurate 3D supervision, fa-
cilitating more stable optimization and improved volumet-
ric reasoning compared to methods relying on 2D depth
rendering. The comparison in Fig. 1 further illustrates the
clear performance gap between 2D rendering-based meth-
ods and our 3D shelf-supervised approach. A similar trend
is observed on the RayIoU metric [35], which provides a
more depth-consistent evaluation of volumetric predictions.
The results in Tab. 2 show that across all evaluated ranges
(1m, 2m, and 4m), our pseudo-labels lead to consistent
improvements in RayIoU when training COTR, CVT-Occ
and STCOcc, highlighting the generality and robustness of
the generated supervision signal. Furthermore, the qualita-
tive results in Fig. 3 demonstrate several key advantages of
our approach. The pseudo-labels generated by our frame-
work are noticeably denser than the LiDAR-based ground
truth, providing more comprehensive spatial coverage of
the scene.
When training on these labels, the networks
learn to effectively suppress noise and artifacts present in
the raw pseudo-labels, yielding smooth and coherent oc-
cupancy maps. Moreover, the models demonstrate strong
completion capabilities, successfully reconstructing the full
extent of partially visible objects and improving overall
scene consistency. We provide further results and compar-
isons with LiDAR-based and supervised approaches in the
supplementary material.
4.4. Ablation Study
Label Quality and Semantic Segmentation.
We first
evaluate the quality of the generated pseudo-labels by di-
rectly comparing them against the Occ3D-nuScenes bench-
mark, as shown in Tab. 3. This experiment assesses the
intrinsic accuracy of the pseudo-labels independent of any
model training. Without sky grounding, the pseudo-labels
already capture the overall scene structure but contain sub-
stantial noise and misclassifications. Introducing the pro-
posed sky grounding technique leads to a notable improve-
ment of +3.41 mIoU (a 55% relative increase) and +8.79
geometric IoU (a 51% relative increase), indicating that bet-
ter sky segmentation substantially enhances 2D semantic
mask quality and reduces false positives and negatives in
the projected 3D labels. While the pseudo-labels capture
the general scene structure, their performance remains con-
siderably below that of models trained on them, confirming
that off-the-shelf foundation models alone are insufficient
for high-quality occupancy prediction. However, when used
as supervision, the models trained on these pseudo-labels
exhibit strong generalization and completion capabilities,
filling in missing geometry and correcting inconsistencies.
The direct gain from sky grounding persists but is smaller
after training (+0.39 mIoU and +1.8geometric IoU), indi-
cating that the model can effectively learn to correct residual
noise and resolve label ambiguities.

ShelfOcc pseudo-labels when directly evaluated on the Occ3D-

Visibility Mask.
We analyze the influence of using the
generated camera visibility mask, which restricts supervi-
sion to regions observable by the cameras, cf. Tab. 4. Ap-
plying the mask leads to a significant improvement in both
IoU and mIoU compared to training without it, highlighting
its importance for 3D supervision in this setting.
Confidence Filter.
We further ablate the effect of the pro-
posed confidence filtering techniques in Sec. 3.3. As shown
in Tab. 5, disabling the confidence filter during pseudo-label
generation leads to a decrease of −1.88 in mIoU and −1.63
in IoU, showing that our proposed pipeline produces cleaner
pseudo-labels.

Aggregation.
We further ablate the geometric aggrega-
tion pipeline to isolate the benefits of each version (see
Fig. 1).
We compare three configurations: (1) Pseudo-
label generation on a per-frame basis, (2) Aggregation over
time without explicit handling of dynamic objects, (3) Full
pipeline including dynamic object processing. We gener-
ate pseudo-labels with each configuration and train STCOcc
on each, cf. Tab. 6.
Even the single-frame version sur-
passes previous shelf-supervised approaches in both IoU
and mIoU, underscoring the inherent strength of our 3D su-
pervision. Temporal aggregation yields a substantial boost,

particularly in geometric IoU, by reinforcing consistent
static scene structures. However, this includes practically
unacceptable model violations for dynamic objects. Finally,
incorporating explicit dynamic object handling achieves an
additional relative gain of approximately 5% in mIoU, in-
dicating that accurate modeling of dynamic objects, despite
their rarity, is essential for autonomous driving.
5. Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we introduced ShelfOcc, a novel training
framework for shelf-supervised occupancy estimation. We
presented a comprehensive framework to generate high-
quality, metrically-scaled 3D semantic voxel pseudo-labels
by leveraging a 3D geometry foundation model (MapAny-
thing [25]) in conjunction with a 2D semantic foundation
model (GroundedSAM [45]). Our generation pipeline ad-
dresses challenges posed by large dynamic scenes, enabling
the creation of precise 3D supervisory signals. By training
different occupancy networks with these 3D pseudo-labels,
we demonstrated substantial performance improvements
over previous shelf-supervised methods, notably closing
the gap to methods trained with full LiDAR supervision.
This work marks a significant milestone in making high-
performance 3D occupancy estimation more scalable and
accessible for real-world autonomous driving applications.
Future work could focus on further enhancing the qual-
ity of the generated pseudo-labels, particularly for rare or
fine-grained categories. Current models struggle with long-
tail classes that are underrepresented or visually ambigu-
ous, which can lead to incomplete or noisy semantic occu-
pancy. Another important avenue is the improved model-
ing of dynamic objects. In the current framework, dynamic
elements are reconstructed based on single-frame observa-
tions, which limits the completeness of their 3D shapes. In-
tegrating motion cues such as optical flow, scene flow, or
multi-frame object tracking could enable temporal align-
ment and accumulation of dynamic object geometry across
time. This would not only produce more complete dynamic
reconstructions but also extend shelf-supervised 3D label-
ing toward temporally consistent 4D scene understanding.

ShelfOcc: Native 3D Supervision beyond LiDAR for
Vision-Based Occupancy Estimation
Supplementary Material
A. Additional Qualitative Results
We provide further qualitative comparisons to comple-
ment the results in the main paper.
First, we compare
STCOcc [34] trained on our pseudo-labels against the pre-
vious state-of-the-art method GaussianFlowOcc [2], as well
as the Occ3D-nuScenes ground truth [55] in Fig. A.1. For
each scene, we show the three front-facing camera images
alongside 3D predictions rendered from an elevated third-
person viewpoint behind the ego vehicle for a single frame.
STCOcc produces clean, dense, and well-regularized oc-
cupancy predictions with minimal noise or depth bleed-
ing, whereas GaussianFlowOcc exhibits pronounced arti-
facts stemming from its 2D supervision pipeline.
It is
clearly visible that the model trained with our framework
can correctly estimate the 3D shape of objects, while previ-
ous work suffers from depth bleeding.
We also visualize the effect of the different versions of
our proposed pipeline introduced in Fig. 1, rendered from a
top-down viewpoint in Fig. A.2. The na¨ıve single-frame
variant (version 1) yields sparse and incomplete geome-
try, missing large portions of the scene. Aggregating all
points across the sequence without distinguishing motion
(version 2) introduces object trails and leads to missing ob-
jects when low-confidence points are filtered out, both of
which degrade the supervision quality. In contrast, our fi-
nal design (version 3), which explicitly separates static and
dynamic content and applies confidence filtering only to the
static scene, produces a dense, coherent scene without trails
or missing objects.
B. Additional Quantitative Results
B.1. Comparison to LiDAR-Supervised Methods
Table B.1 provides an extended comparison between our ap-
proach and methods that rely on LiDAR for supervision,
including weakly supervised approaches AGO [31] and
VEON [75] using LiDAR data, as well as fully supervised
methods trained with semantic 3D ground truth. Interest-
ingly, both COTR and CVT-Occ, when trained solely on our
pseudo-labels, achieve competitive performance relative to
AGO and even surpass VEON, despite both of the latter re-
lying on LiDAR for geometric supervision. STCOcc sur-
passes them even more clearly in terms of mIoU. Unfor-
tunately, the authors of these methods do not report geo-
metric IoU, where we would expect them to perform more
strongly due to their access to LiDAR depth. These findings
highlight that our LiDAR-free, shelf-supervised framework
can match or even outperform prior methods that depend on
LiDAR supervision for geometry. At the same time, there
remains a performance gap compared to fully supervised
methods trained directly on densely annotated LiDAR voxel
labels. While LiDAR-based occupancy estimation is not the
focus of this work, we provide these numbers to contextu-
alize the remaining room for improvement relative to full
3D supervision. We omit AutoOcc [78] from this compari-
son, as we were unable to retrace their differing evaluation
protocol.
B.2. Per-Class Semantic Segmentation Ablation
We additionally report per-class performance for the seman-
tic segmentation ablation (cf. Tab. 3) in Tab. B.2. The re-
sults confirm that the proposed sky grounding technique
substantially improves the quality of the pseudo-labels
across almost all classes. By reducing spurious false posi-
tives from the open-vocabulary detector the resulting labels
become significantly cleaner and more stable. Notably, im-
provements are pronounced for low-frequency classes such
as bus, traffic cone, and truck. For these categories, sky
grounding prevents the detector from erroneously predict-
ing object boxes in every frame, enabling more accurate
class assignments and reducing confusion with the back-
ground.
B.3. Ablation on Resolution and Backbone
We further investigate the impact of input image resolution
and backbone capacity on models trained with our ShelfOcc
pseudo-labels in Tab. B.3. For this study, we use CVT-Occ
as the representative architecture.
Our results show that
CVT-Occ benefits noticeably from scaling both the back-
bone and the input resolution. Doubling the resolution to
512 × 1408 and replacing the ResNet-50 encoder with a
larger ResNet-101 already yields a clear improvement in
semantic mIoU. Increasing the resolution further to the full
nuScenes input size leads to additional gains, improving not
only mIoU but also geometric IoU. We also experimented
with VoVNet-99, which has a parameter count comparable
to ResNet-101. While its semantic mIoU is similar to that
of ResNet-101, it achieves slightly lower geometric IoU,
suggesting that encoder architecture plays a nontrivial role
in exploiting the pseudo-label supervision. Overall, these
findings indicate that our 3D supervision pipeline can effec-
tively leverage higher-resolution inputs and stronger back-
bones, offering additional room for performance scaling.

how version 3 avoids sparsity, object trails, and missing objects, resulting in clean and coherent 3D supervision.

C. Details on Semantic Segmentation
We provide the full vocabulary used to query the open-
vocabulary detector Grounding DINO [36] in Tab. C.4. As
described in the main paper, each category is queried in-
dividually by forwarding a prompt of the form “QUERY
. sky” through the model. Including the background to-
ken sky encourages the detector to identify sky regions ex-
plicitly, which in turn reduces false positives for the target
query. For each forward pass, we discard all predicted boxes
corresponding to sky and retain only the boxes associated
with the target query. To ensure high-quality detections,
we further filter out any box whose predicted logit falls be-
low 0.2. All remaining boxes across all query categories
are aggregated and passed to the SAM segmentation model,
which generates a mask for each box. The logit of the origi-
nating Grounding DINO detection is assigned to every pixel
within the corresponding SAM mask. To construct the fi-
nal semantic segmentation map, we overlay all predicted
masks and perform per-pixel selection based on the highest
associated logit. This produces a dense, open-vocabulary
segmentation result that serves as the semantic input to our
pseudo-label generation pipeline.
