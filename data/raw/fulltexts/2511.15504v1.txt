Abstract
Natural and idiomatic expressions are essential for fluent, everyday
communication, yet many second-language learners struggle to
acquire and spontaneously use casual slang despite strong formal
proficiency. To address this gap, we designed and evaluated an LLM-
powered, task-based role-playing game in which a GPT-4o-based
Game Master guides learners through an immersive, three-phase
spoken narrative. After selecting five unfamiliar slang phrases to
practice, participants engage in open-ended dialogue with non-
player characters; the Game Master naturally incorporates the tar-
get phrases in rich semantic contexts (implicit input enhancement)
while a dedicated Practice Box provides real-time explicit track-
ing and encouragement. Post-session, learners receive multi-level
formative feedback analyzing the entire interaction.
We evaluated the system in a between-subjects study with 14
international graduate students, randomly assigned to either the
RPG condition or a control condition consisting of a traditional
AI-led virtual classroom. Results from an immediate post-test show
that the RPG group achieved greater gains in both comprehension
of the target phrases and their accurate, contextual use in sentences.
Quantitative analysis of in-activity word-usage frequency, com-
bined with qualitative survey responses, further indicates that the
game-based approach provided more practice opportunities and
higher perceived engagement, resulting in a more natural learning
experience. These findings highlight the potential of narrative-
driven LLM interactions in vocabulary acquisition.

Introduction
Language is a fundamental tool for human communication, en-
abling individuals to share information, convey ideas, and interact
socially and professionally [41, 47]. In a globalized world, effec-
tive communication across cultural and linguistic boundaries is
essential for both collaboration and coexistence. Universities pro-
vide a clear illustration of this need, as individuals from diverse
backgrounds come together to learn, research, and exchange ideas.
In the 2023-2024 academic year alone, over 1.1 million interna-
tional students were enrolled in U.S. higher education institutions,
comprising approximately 6% of the total student population [34].
Despite general proficiency as measured by standardized language
assessments such as TOEFL [45] and IELTS [18] many learners con-
tinue to face challenges in using language actively across diverse
and spontaneous interaction settings. The speaking components of
these exams tend to reflect structured, academic scenarios, offering

loop. Spoken user input is transcribed by Whisper and sent
to the GPT-4o Game Master along with the current game
state, predefined scene assets as well as descriptions of NPCs.
The Game Master dynamically advances the narrative, se-
lects and displays the appropriate background and speak-
ing/companion NPC(s) based on the player’s actions and lo-
cation, updates visual elements, and naturally recasts the
learner’s target slang phrases in meaningful contexts when
situationally appropriate.
only a partial view of a learner’s communicative ability in infor-
mal, imaginative, or less predictable conversations [19]. As a result,
students may score well on these exams yet continue to struggle
with real-time conversations and natural syntax use in academic or
social settings.
Language teaching methods have continuously evolved over
the centuries. Traditional approaches began with the Grammar-
Translation Method (GTM) [7], which emphasized grammatical

structures and the translation of texts from the learner’s native
language into the target language. This was followed by the Audio-
Lingual Method [33], which focused on memorization of dialogues
and the use of repetitive drills to develop listening and speaking
skills, with special emphasis on pronunciation. The focus then
shifted to the Direct Method [11], which emphasized instruction en-
tirely in the target language. In this approach, comprehension was
developed without explicit grammar instruction. An offshoot of the
Direct Method was Content-Based Instruction (CBI), including mod-
els like CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) [3, 12],
which borrowed from immersion programs and prioritized spoken
communication through topic-based curricula rather than grammar
or vocabulary drills. These traditional and early modern methods
typically positioned the teacher as the central source of knowledge,
with students playing passive roles. However, with the emergence
of more modern pedagogical frameworks, the teacher’s role grad-
ually shifted to that of a facilitator, supporting students in more
active, collaborative learning such as cooperative learning [10, 42],
which integrates academic and social activities, and Community
Language Learning [22, 49], which emphasizes trust and student
autonomy, embody this shift. The Task-Based Learning Method
(TBLT) [13, 27], which has gained renewed attention in recent years,
focuses on the use of authentic language to accomplish meaningful
tasks in the target language. These modern methods have been fur-
ther enhanced by technological advancements: virtual reality[51],
artificial intelligence [43], and gamification [48] are increasingly
being integrated into language education to create more immersive
experiences that support engagement through learner-driven nar-
ratives.
Game-based learning, which has gained popularity in recent years,
demonstrates moderate to large effects on cognitive, social, emo-
tional, motivational, and engagement outcomes, making it a promis-
ing educational tool [29]. Studies have reported significant increases
in both learner motivation and retention within gamified learning
environments [25, 50], along with a notable reduction in language
learning anxiety over time [8]. With the advancement of large lan-
guage models (LLMs) [35], including models like ChatGPT-4o, their
application in language learning has become increasingly popular
due to their capabilities in refining student writing and enhancing
the quality of instructional feedback. Beyond instructional uses,
ChatGPT serves as a self-learning tool, enabling independent lan-
guage acquisition and cultural exploration [32]. Concurrently, in
game design, LLMs are naturally suited for facilitating natural lan-
guage conversations, functioning as non-player character (NPC)
dialogue systems, and assuming mastering or assistive roles within
games [14]. This convergence presents a compelling opportunity to
integrate these domains, leveraging LLMs to create immersive, inter-
active, and student-centric language learning experiences through
game-based environments.
In this work, we aim to develop a task-based, interactive language
learning system that leverages a large language model (LLM) agent
as the master of an immersive, storytelling-driven Dungeons &
Dragons-style role-playing game. The system is designed to encour-
age learners to engage in active spoken interaction using casual
slang phrases as target expressions in their responses. Following
the interaction, the system provides targeted quantitative and qual-
itative feedback on grammar and usage of the target vocabulary to
support reinforcement and further language development.
Our key contributions are as follows:
• We designed and developed a domain-specific game-based
language learning system that integrates an LLM-driven
narrative with dynamic visual and verbal interaction cues.
The system updates visual elements in real time based on
story progression and learner performance, enabling an
immersive experience.
• We incorporate a hybrid language learning approach that
combines implicit and explicit feedback mechanisms. Dur-
ing gameplay, the agent subtly reinforces target expressions
through natural recasting, and the system continuously
tracks the learner’s usage of target slang words. The Post-
interaction modules then provide explicit feedback through
usage summaries, targeted corrections, and structured prac-
tice opportunities.

Related Work
In this section, we review the advancement of AI technologies in
language learning, with a focus on the capabilities of large lan-
guage models (LLMs), and explore the pedagogical potential of role-
playing games as interactive, engaging environments that align
well with communicative learning objectives.
2.1
AI in Language Learning
The history of AI in language learning largely began with chatbot-
style systems, grounded in early advances in natural language
processing (NLP) and machine learning [6]. Early systems such as
ELIZA [52] were based on rule-based pattern matching and lacked
the ability to interpret the meaning of user input. These systems
simulated conversation but offered little in terms of contextual
understanding or dynamic feedback. Subsequent developments
included systems like Gengobot, a grammar dictionary chatbot
designed for Japanese language learning [16], and CSIEC, which
could generate simple communicative responses based on user in-
put [21]. With the rise of deep learning and more advanced NLP
techniques, conversational AI systems evolved to comprehend user
intent, context, and sentiment, leading to more natural and flex-
ible interactions. Commercial tools such as Quizlet, Ginger, and
ProWritingAid began incorporating these capabilities to provide
intelligent support in vocabulary acquisition, grammar correction,
and writing enhancement [37].
Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbots now offer a wide
range of capabilities that can enhance the language learning process.
Several studies have examined their potential to serve as real-time
conversational partners, helping learners practice speaking and
writing, understand idiomatic expressions and cultural references,
and build fluency and confidence [1, 4, 9, 17, 20, 24, 26]. In [38],
the authors developed an LLM-powered chatbot fine-tuned specifi-
cally for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. The system
initiates dialogue based on real-world themes (e.g., ordering food,
job interviews). Learners speak or type responses, and the system
generates contextually appropriate replies. It offers subtle feedback

Game Master LLM: Task-Based Role-Playing for Natural Slang Learning
and rephrasing options, and learners can also ask grammar-related
questions to receive in-depth explanations. In [44], the authors
introduced Ruffle&Riley, a conversational tutoring system that cre-
ates a dialogue-driven learning environment using LLMs. After
selecting a lesson topic, the system automatically generates a tu-
toring script and facilitates a conversation between two AI agents,
Ruffle (student) and Riley (tutor). Learners can observe or assume
the role of Ruffle, interacting with Riley in a goal-focused dialogue.
Throughout the session, the system prompts learners with reflective
questions (e.g., “What do you think the main argument in this para-
graph is?”), and provides feedback on engagement, comprehension,
and suggested follow-ups.
In [36], they present ELLMA-T, an embodied LLM-powered avatar
integrated into a social virtual reality (VR) environment. Learners
enter immersive scenarios such as restaurants, airports, or class-
rooms, and engage in natural voice-based interactions. The agent
is capable of real-time multi-turn conversations, adjusting its be-
havior based on learner proficiency and task context (e.g., giving a
presentation versus casual dialogue). Sessions may be recorded and
reviewed post-hoc, with feedback provided on vocabulary usage,
missed speech opportunities, and overall performance.
In general, the recent trend in language education technology re-
flects a shift from isolated features such as grammar correction
toward more immersive, interaction-driven experiences, an evo-
lution that aligns closely with modern pedagogical approaches
emphasizing communicative competence and learner-centered en-
gagement.
2.2
Linguistic Assessment and Feedback
Methods
In the analysis of language proficiency, accuracy is considered
one of the major dimensions [5]. It refers to the extent to which
a learner’s output adheres to the grammatical rules, vocabulary
usage, and phonological or orthographic conventions of the tar-
get language. In this dimension, various types of feedback have
been proposed to enhance learning outcomes. These include gen-
eral feedback, which conveys overall information about errors (e.g.,
number, type); specific feedback, which provides sentence-based
analysis with explanations and correction suggestions; and for-
mative feedback, which summarizes errors and strengths while
suggesting pathways for improvement [46]. In terms of instruc-
tional approaches, language learning can be supported through
both implicit and explicit strategies. Implicit feedback techniques,
such as recasts, prompts, or clarification requests, encourage learn-
ers to use target phrases through natural interaction without direct
correction, allowing patterns to be acquired subconsciously. In
contrast, explicit feedback conveys corrective information directly,
making the learner consciously attend to the target form. Studies
have shown that these approaches differ in their effects: explicit
feedback often leads to stronger immediate gains, whereas implicit
feedback tends to yield better long-term retention[28].
2.3
Role-Playing Games
Role-playing games (RPGs) are a popular and widely varied cate-
gory of games. Due to their broad and diverse formats, they can
be difficult to define precisely; however, there are key properties
that distinguish them from other game types. At their core, RPGs
involve "playing a role", that is, embodying someone else’s perspec-
tive in an interactive process of defining and re-defining the state,
properties, and contents of an imaginary game world [53]. This
emphasis on freedom, character embodiment, and player-centric
mechanics, makes RPGs well aligned with modern language learn-
ing methodologies that prioritize communication, and contextual
engagement. Several studies [2, 23, 30, 31, 39] support this claim,
showing that role-playing not only enhances language instruction,
particularly in developing speaking skills, but also fosters posi-
tive learner behaviors, attitudes, and overall engagement with the
learning process beyond just English proficiency.

Hypotheses and Research Questions
We hypothesize that integrating a task-based language learning
framework within a role-playing game environment, guided by
a large language model (LLM), can enhance learners’ active lan-
guage use, engagement, and awareness of their own performance.
Specifically, we propose that:
(H1) Learners who interact with the LLM-driven role-playing
game will demonstrate a better understanding of the mean-
ings of target words, higher accuracy in their use and asso-
ciated syntactic structures.
(H2) The immersive, narrative-driven structure of the game will
result in higher learner engagement, as evidenced by self-
reported measures and interaction activity data.

Methodology
In this section, we first provide a high-level overview of the user-
facing design and interaction flow for both the experimental (RPG-
based) and control (traditional AI classroom) conditions. We then
describe the shared technical architecture that powers the system,
followed by the experimental procedure, participant details, and
evaluation measures.
4.1
System Overview
4.1.1
Experimental Group. The system operates as a dyadic [54],
spoken turn-based interaction, where communication is understood
as a mutual and evolving exchange between two agents: the user
and a GPT-based Master of the game. The main goal of this ex-
change is to collaboratively move the narrative forward. The Game
Master (GM) establishes and dynamically adjusts the game world
and its consequences, while the player drives the plot forward by
making decisions and taking actions within that environment. The
introduction of the game follows two principles: world-building
and role embodiment. World-building is delivered through a short
animated video that conveys the background and central mission.
Role embodiment is fostered by letting participants choose one of
four distinct heroes, each introduced with unique visuals and a
short description of their special abilities. In each turn, the user re-
ceives the current narrative state of the game through the Master’s
Dialogue Box, then responds verbally by pressing record button
(Fig. 4). The system processes the input and advances the narrative,
updating both verbal and non-verbal cues, such as the background
environment and the NPCs’ persona, according to the evolving
game state. A dedicated Practice Box (right side of the interface,

Figure 2: Overview of Game Modules and LLM Narrative Generation: The agent receives the core game materials, including a
set of NPC characters with brief descriptions to guide narrative progression, the current game state with possible locations and
encounters, the set of target phrases, and the player’s chosen hero with its associated abilities and decision history. Based on
these inputs, the model generates the next narrative segment, integrates the target phrases along with contextual explanations,
and outputs the next game state and the next speaking NPC. The visual interface is then updated according to the agent’s
interpretation.
Figure 4) displays the five selected target slang phrases along with
their meanings and example sentences. The system automatically
detects and tracks each phrase’s usage in the learner’s spoken input,
updating a real-time color-coded progress indicator: red after one
detected use and green after two. Our design goal is for each target
phrase to be practiced at least twice during the 12-turn game; al-
though usage does not affect narrative progression, the box serves
as a persistent visual scaffold, and occasional pop-up reminders gen-
tly encourage learners to incorporate unused or once-used phrases.
In addition to the explicit support from the Practice Box, the Game
Master regularly uses the target slang phrases in its own dialogue
throughout all game phases. These phrases appear in meaningful
context or are paired with synonyms (e.g., “Do you really want to
go in without preparation and wing it?”), giving learners repeated,
authentic exposure to correct meaning and situational usage. An
overview of the core modules and information flow that enable
the Game Master to generate coherent, context-aware narrative
responses is shown in Figure 2.
The narrative structure follows a phase-based design, where each
phase presents distinct goals and challenges. The game’s educa-
tional structure is built around three main phases. Throughout the
game, the user interacts with a predefined set of in-game characters.
as shown in Fig. 3:
• Phase 1: Preparation and Information Gathering The
initial stage requires players to engage in dialogue with
characters to ask for guidance. This phase also allows play-
ers to form a group with the non playable characters (NPCs)
for the subsequent adventure.
• Phase 2: Exploration and Problem-Solving This stage
presents players with a series of puzzles and challenges.
Successfully solving them grants specific abilities or skills
for later use. Players can also explore the environment to
find equipment and weapons.
• Phase 3: Strategy and Leadership The final phase in-
volves a tactical battle. Victory depends on the player’s
ability to strategically use their character’s acquired skills
and resources to lead their party.
This three-phase design is intended to place language learners
in diverse communication scenarios. The narrative structure allows
for branching: while player decisions create different paths within
each phase, all paths converge at a single point before the narrative
advances to the next stage. Final outcomes are determined based on
a combination of checkpoint values and the Master’s assessment.
4.1.2
Control Group. The control group also follows a 12-turn,
level-based structure divided into an introduction, ten steps of prac-
ticing target words, and a final summary step. In the introduction,
the agent presents itself as an AI teacher, and during the ten practice

The game is organized into sequential phases, each contain-
ing distinct communicative goals and challenges. Within
each phase, player responses drive branching interactions
(illustrated by multiple paths and NPC portraits). All paths
converge at a checkpoint before advancing to the next phase.

steps, each target word is covered over two turns: first, the agent
introduces the word and its meaning and asks the user to produce a
sentence with it; then, after receiving the user’s response, the agent
analyzes the sentence and provides explicit feedback on meaning
accuracy or grammatical issues. It then proceeds to the next word.
The session concludes with an outro summarizing the interaction.
4.2
System Architecture
To enable seamless, interactive gameplay and language learning,
user speech is first transcribed using Whisper, a multilingual auto-
matic speech recognition (ASR) model developed by OpenAI [40].
The transcribed input is then processed by GPT-4o, which generates
narrative responses grounded in the current game context. These

generated narrative and prompts in response to user input.

responses are vocalized using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, pro-
ducing real-time, natural-sounding audio output [15]. To support
accessibility and reinforce comprehension, subtitles are displayed
alongside audio responses, offering users dual verbal cues.
For non-verbal feedback, we utilize two main channels: dynamic
game state visuals and character state indicators. Each game state
(e.g., combat, negotiation, exploration) is associated with pregen-
erated visual assets, which are selected and updated based on the
agent’s internal narrative evaluation. This visual system ensures
that the environment remains responsive and contextually coherent
throughout the interaction.
4.3
Experimental Setup
4.3.1
Participants. We recruited 16 international students (aged
21-30), all of whom had met the English language proficiency re-
quirement for university admission (minimum TOEFL score of
90) and were actively engaged in English learning. Participants
were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (LLM-
assisted RPG interaction) or the control group. Two participants
failed to complete the full session (one from each condition) and
were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 14 participants
were randomly assigned to either the experimental condition (RPG
interaction, n=7) or the control condition (AI classroom, n=7).
4.3.2
Task Flow. The overall task flow is the same for both the
experimental and control groups and is shown in Figure 6. First, the
system presents 12 predefined slang phrases and asks participants
to select 5 phrases they are unfamiliar with or less comfortable
using. These phrases were chosen based on recommendations from
English instructors at Purdue who work with international stu-
dents and frequently observe difficulties with these expressions.
After selecting 5 phrases, the system asks participants to indicate
whether they are completely unfamiliar with each word, somewhat
familiar with it, or able to guess its meaning. To more precisely
assess partial knowledge, participants who claimed they partially
knew a word were asked to verbally define its meaning and use it
in a sentence.
After the initial assessment, participants were assigned to either

the control or experimental group to practice their selected phrases
with the AI agent, either through a virtual English class or through
the game setup described in the previous sections. Both groups
completed a 12-turn dialogue with the AI agent, which lasted ap-
proximately 30 minutes on average.
The activity is followed by a post-interaction feedback phase, whose
goal is to provide a general assessment of the interaction with a
focus on the Accuracy dimension. The agent is prompted to deliver
multi-level written feedback, which includes: (1) general feedback
summarizing the number and types of errors; (2) specific feedback
offering sentence-level corrections and explanations; and (3) forma-
tive feedback that revisits the target word list, evaluates whether
each term was used, and, when applicable, analyzes its correctness
and appropriateness while optionally providing examples or revised
uses. Then in a immediate assessment, participants are asked to
define the meaning of each phrase and use it in a sentence, and
they receive brief textual feedback on their usage.
4.3.3
Measures. In this study, we use multiple sources for ana-
lyzing linguistic performance and engagement. For the language-
related measures, we evaluate participants’ understanding and use
of the target words across the initial assessment and the immedi-
ate post-test. These measures include word meaning accuracy and
contextual appropriateness, meaning that even if there are some
issues such as grammar, the intended meaning and situational use
are correct. Engagement was evaluated using a self-reported sur-
vey administered immediately after the post-test, supplemented by
thematic analysis of participants’ open-ended responses.
5
Results & Discussion
In this section, we present both qualitative and quantitative findings.
We organize our preliminary results into two parts: (1) language
learning performance, with immediate post-intervention gains (2)
engagement outcomes based on self-reported surveys; and qualita-
tive feedback and observations.
5.1
Language Learning Performance
To evaluate linguistic performance, we quantified participants’ un-
derstanding of the target phrases using a three-tiered scoring rubric.
A score of 1.0 was awarded for a correct and comprehensive defini-
tion, 0.5 for a partially correct definition, and 0.0 for an incorrect
definition or if the participant was unable to provide one. The as-
sessment of semantic accuracy for both the definitions and the
participant-generated sentences was performed using GPT-4o. This
evaluation was specifically calibrated to prioritize contextual ap-
propriateness and intended meaning, disregarding grammatical
errors that did not impede comprehension, consistent with our
measurements.
Analysis of the pre-test data indicated a baseline imbalance be-
tween cohorts; the experimental group demonstrated a slightly
higher initial proficiency with the target phrases compared to the
control group, scoring 1.50 compared to 1.12. To account for this
discrepancy and accurately measure gains relative to each group’s
starting point, we calculated a normalized growth rate. This ap-
proach mitigates the ceiling effect for participants with higher
pre-test scores. The formula is defined as:
𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑡ℎ𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒= 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒−𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒
𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒−𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒
(1)
where scores ranged from 0 (completely incorrect or no response)
to 5 (perfect definition and appropriate contextual use), making
5 the maximum possible score. We applied this formula to the
average scores for both definition accuracy and correct sentence
generation. The resulting normalized growth rates for both cohorts
are presented in Table 1. The data indicates that the RPG group
achieved a higher growth rate in both measures.

While both cohorts demonstrated substantial improvement, these
findings suggest that the immersive, task-based RPG framework
was comparatively more effective in enhancing learners’ semantic
understanding and contextual application of the target phrases.

Furthermore, a disparity in active language application was ob-
served. As detailed in Table 2, the experimental (RPG) group utilized
the target phrases substantially more often than the control group,
Table 2: Mean Frequency of Target Vocabulary Usage

10.14
While the control group was explicitly required to use each target
phrase (with the AI teacher directly prompting its incorporation in
every turn), participants in the game condition were never obliged
to do so. The Game Master frequently modelled the phrases and
occasional pop-up reminders encouraged their use, but incorpo-
ration remained entirely optional and had no effect on narrative
progression or story outcomes. We hypothesize that the immersive,
task-based environment of the game provided a compelling con-
text and a functional incentive for this increased application. Also,
the design, which features the "Practice Words" box as a persis-
tent visual aid, explicitly tracks performance and visually indicates
which phrases have been used. This scaffolding mechanism likely
prompted learners to actively and repeatedly integrate the target
vocabulary within the narrative context to satisfy the task-based
requirements.
In the post-test sentence-creation task, the two most highly en-
gaged participants from RPG group (identified by response length
and narrative creativity) spontaneously transferred elements of the
game’s fictional world into their examples, incorporating references
to the game. In contrast, the majority of participants across both
conditions contextualized the target slang within familiar daily
routines, For example P6 said:
"As I’m reaching the deadline, I think there’s no time
and I need to wing it."
or P8:
"Every day after work, I take a shower. It helps me
shake off the stress."
This pattern suggests that, while deep story immersion can foster
creative transfer of the game context for highly engaged learners,
most users default to real-life scenarios. A promising direction
for future work would therefore be personalized storytelling that
adapts the narrative to each learner’s own daily routines and con-
cerns, which may yield even stronger and more personally relevant
learning outcomes.
5.2
Engagement Outcomes
To evaluate subjective engagement and user experience, we an-
alyzed participant responses to a post-activity survey. All self-
reported data was quantified using a five-point Likert scale, cor-
responding to the following mapping: (1) "Strongly disagree," (2)
"Somewhat disagree," (3) "Neither agree nor disagree," (4) "Some-
what agree," and (5) "Strongly agree."
As illustrated in Fig. 7, the experimental (RPG) group reported
a more positive experience than the control group across all mea-
sures. Specifically, participants in the game group perceived the
environment as more engaging, found the narrative contexts more
useful for understanding vocabulary, and felt the system provided
a superior opportunity to practice the target phrases.
Beyond the quantitative ratings, qualitative feedback from the
experimental group further elucidates why the game was perceived
as more engaging and effective. A recurring theme was the system’s
narrative autonomy and its impact on contextual application. Par-
ticipants appreciated that the game’s adaptive storyline provided
a meaningful framework for deciding how and when to use the
target phrases. As P1 explained:
"It adapts to the user’s response and let’s the user cre-
ate his own unique story (though within the general
synopsis of the story), which I find very helpful in
letting me decide where to use what words."
A second prominent theme was the value of active language
production over the passive reception of information. Participants
felt the game’s task-based mechanics, which required them to use
the vocabulary to advance, were more effective than traditional
drill-based methods. P7 articulated this distinction:
"It didn’t feel like the vocabs were spoon fed to me
since I was required to produce language through
making sentences and speaking them out."
These comments suggest that the RPG framework successfully
created an environment where learners were intrinsically motivated
to use the target language.

In this work, we designed, developed, and evaluated an LLM-powered
role-playing game that employs a task-based language learning
framework to enhance learners’ acquisition and spontaneous use
of casual English slang vocabulary. Our findings demonstrate that

accuracy, and correct sentence generation. Furthermore, the RPG
group demonstrated significantly higher active vocabulary usage,
applying the target phrases much more frequently during the activ-
ity than the control group. The qualitative survey results suggest
that participants perceived the game environment as more engag-
ing. Furthermore, the data indicates that the examples and narration
provided within the game were more effective in supporting their
learning compared to the control group.

Limitations & Future Work
Having more participants would yield more robust and reliable
statistical insights, so we plan to continue our work by recruit-
ing additional subjects. Another aspect that can be measured is
long-term retention, which we intend to evaluate by repeating the
post-test approximately one week after the activity. For future work,
several directions are possible: expanding feedback modalities to
include not only accuracy but also complexity, fluency, and pronun-
ciation of the target phrases; and exploring alternative storytelling
and game-mechanic designs that can be implemented and tested.
