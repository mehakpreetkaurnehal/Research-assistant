Abstract
RL (reinforcement learning) methods (e.g., GRPO) for
MLLM (Multimodal LLM) perception ability has attracted
wide research interest owing to its remarkable generaliza-
tion ability. Nevertheless, existing reinforcement learning
methods still face the problem of low data quality, where
data samples cannot elicit diverse responses from MLLMs,
thus restricting the exploration scope for MLLM reinforce-
ment learning. Some methods attempt to mitigate this prob-
lem by imposing constraints on entropy, but none address
it at its root. Therefore, to tackle this problem, this work
proposes Syn-GRPO (Synthesis-GRPO), which employs an
online data generator to synthesize high-quality training
data with diverse responses in GRPO training. Specifically,
Syn-GRPO consists of two components: (1) data server; (2)
GRPO workflow. The data server synthesizes new samples
from existing ones using an image generation model, featur-
ing a decoupled and asynchronous scheme to achieve high
generation efficiency.
The GRPO workflow provides the
data server with the new image descriptions, and it lever-
ages a diversity reward to supervise the MLLM to predict
image descriptions for synthesizing samples with diverse
responses. Experiment results across three visual percep-
tion tasks demonstrate that Syn-GRPO improves the data
quality by a large margin, achieving significant superior
performance to existing MLLM perception methods, and
Syn-GRPO presents promising potential for scaling long-
term self-evolving RL. Our code is available at https:

1. Introduction
MLLM (Multimodal LLM) perception ability has drawn
widespread research for its role as the prerequisite for all
core functions of MLLMs. Recently, RL (reinforcement
learning) methods (e.g., GRPO [6, 20]) fit well with MLLM
perception training, owing to its strong generalization and
visual perception tasks’ inherent verifiable labels. There-

Low-entropy Answers
Figure 1. In GRPO training, the MLLM generates non-diverse
answers with low entropy, restricting the exploration space of RL.
fore, numerous reasoning methods (e.g., VLM-R1 [22],
Visual-RFT [13], VisionReasoner [12]) based on GRPO
have significantly promoted MLLM perception ability.
Despite these developments, existing RL methods for
MLLM perception still encounter the problem of low data
quality. Low data quality refers to the issue where data
samples fail to stimulate diverse responses from MLLMs,
thereby limiting the exploration space for MLLM reinforce-
ment learning, as shown in Figure 1. To investigate this
problem, this work analyzes the entropy and diversity dur-
ing GRPO training for perception reasoning. Specifically,
the entropy reflects the uncertainty of the MLLM’s out-
put distribution, and the diversity measures the variety of
multiple responses for each sample. Figure 2 shows that
the entropy and diversity of the MLLM exhibit a trend of
rapid decline (referred to as entropy collapse [28] and diver-
sity collapse), indicating the low quality of visual percep-
tion data and resulting in extremely low training efficiency.
Existing LLM RL methods (e.g., CLIP-Higher [28], CLIP-
Cov [4], KL-Cov [4], Entropy Adv. [3]) attempt to mitigate
this problem from GRPO itself; however, they still cannot
overcome the limitations of low-quality data at the root.
Therefore, to break the data limit, this work proposes
Syn-GRPO (Synthesis-GRPO), which leverages an online
data generator to synthesize high-quality training data with
diverse responses during GRPO training. Syn-GRPO aims
to synthesize new data to replace the old data when process-
ing each training batch, through a self-evolving data syn-
thesis approach. To this end, Syn-GRPO consists of two
components: (1) data server; (2) GRPO workflow.

The data server synthesizes new image data based on the
old image data in the visual perception datasets, featuring
(1) foreground consistency and (2) decoupled design. For
the first feature, the data server first adopts a foreground
segmentation model to remove irrelevant background from
the image, and then uses an outpainting model to generate a
new background. The foreground consistency preserves the
invariance of visual perception task labels after generation,
ensuring accurate supervisory signals during RL training.
Meanwhile, by preserving the foreground, this method also
alleviates the problem of excessive distribution discrepancy
between new and old data. For the second feature, the data
server adopts a data generation scheme that is decoupled
and asynchronous from the GRPO workflow, connected by
a unified API. This separation enables independent manage-
ment of the data server and GRPO workflow while preserv-
ing efficient communication between them.
The GRPO workflow requires the MLLM to predict two
outputs in addition to the original reasoning process and fi-
nal answer: (1) new image description and (2) predicted
diversity. Specifically, the new image description is the text
prompt for the new sample, which will be sent to the data
server along with the old image to generate the new im-
age. The predicted diversity represents the MLLM’s esti-
mation of the response diversity for the input sample. How-
ever, generating images from the predicted image descrip-
tions does not necessarily yield highly diverse responses.
To tackle this problem, the GRPO workflow computes
a diversity reward by comparing the predicted diversity
with the ground-truth diversity from rollout responses. In
this manner, the diversity reward effectively supervises the
MLLM to distinguish whether input samples have diverse
responses, thereby enhancing its ability to generate image
descriptions for samples with diverse responses. Addition-
ally, this work identifies a diversity drift problem, where the
declining trend of the ground-truth diversity causes a shift
in the predicted diversity, and accordingly proposes a diver-
sity smoothing strategy to mitigate it.
We perform comprehensive experiments to validate the
performance of the proposed Syn-GRPO. Specifically, we
apply Syn-GRPO to three types of visual perception tasks:
REC (Referring Expression Comprehension), OVD (Open-
Vocabulary Object Detection), and ISR (Indoor Scene Re-
finement). The experiment results demonstrate that Syn-
GRPO improves the training efficiency of original GRPO
by a large margin, achieving significantly superior perfor-
mance to existing MLLM perception methods.
Further-
more, we reveal two intriguing phenomena: (1) as the size
of the original training dataset increases, Syn-GRPO ex-
hibits a stable performance improvement trend; (2) as train-
ing progresses through iterations, the generated data shows
an increasingly complex trend. These phenomena indicate
that Syn-GRPO, a self-evolving data synthesis approach,

has the potential to achieve long-term scalability in RL.
To sum up, the main contributions of this work can be
summarized as follows:
• We identify and analyze the problem of low data qual-
ity in RL training for MLLM perception.
• We propose Syn-GRPO to tackle this problem, with a
data server to efficiently synthesize data in an asynchronous
manner, and a GRPO workflow to achieve self-evolving
data synthesis through a proposed diversity reward.
• Experiment results across three visual perception tasks
demonstrate that Syn-GRPO significantly outperforms ex-
isting MLLM perception methods, and Syn-GRPO exhibits
promising potential for long-horizon scalability in RL.

Reinforcement Learning for MLLM Perception.
Af-
ter the emergence of DeepSeek-R1, researchers discov-
ered that reinforcement learning (e.g., GRPO) can sig-
nificantly improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs and
MLLMs by triggering chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning,
with many studies applying this method to various do-
mains of LLMs and MLLMs. Among these, RL is par-
ticularly well-suited for MLLM perception tasks, as such
tasks typically come with verifiable labels (e.g., bounding
box annotations). Specifically, VLM-R1 [22] and Visual-
RFT [13] first demonstrate that GRPO significantly outper-
forms SFT on visual perception tasks by directly extend-
ing GRPO through carefully designed task-specific rewards.
Built upon GRPO, SATORI-R1 [21] (three-stage decompo-
sition), Visionary-R1 [25] (caption-reason-answer format),
UniVG-R1 [2] (difficulty-aware weight adjustment), Vi-
sionReasoner [12] (unified framework with non-repeat re-
ward), and Rex-Thinker [8] (HumanRef-CoT dataset) im-
prove MLLM perception by addressing distinct issues and
enhancing framework & structured reasoning.
However,
these methods still suffer from low data quality, resulting
in suboptimal performance.

tion with the exploration space of LLM RL. DAPO [28]
first identified that during GRPO training, the entropy of
the model’s predicted tokens rapidly decreases. After this,
CLIP-Higher [28] (higher GRPO sampling ratio clipping
threshold), Clip-Cov [4] (clip high-covariance tokens), KL-
Cov [4] (KL penalty on high-covariance tokens), and En-
tropy Adv. [3] (entropy-included GRPO advantage) attempt
to address this issue by imposing constraints on entropy.
Despite their advances, these methods remain fundamen-
tally constrained by data quality and exhibit degraded per-
formance on visual perception tasks where data samples fol-
low more uniform formats.
Data Synthesis for LLM Reinforcement Learning. Syn-
thetic data holds great potential to address the problem of
missing data, and data synthesis methods have emerged for
LLM RL. Specifically, PROMPTCOT [31] (emulate expert
problem designers for math problem synthesis), Genetic-
Instruct [15] (Instructor & Coder & Judge-LLM collabora-
tive instruction-code synthesis), METASYNTH [19] (meta-
prompting with multiple-LLM agent collaboration), and
TaskCraft [24] (automated workflow for multi-tool verifi-
able agent tasks) advance data synthesis via distinct collab-
orative or workflow-driven strategies. Absolute Zero [30]
and R-Zero [7] propose an additional generation scheme
to synthesize data along with the GRPO training. How-
ever, these data synthesis methods are either inapplicable
to visual perception tasks or offline-generated, lacking self-
evolution and failing to adaptively synthesize data.
3. Method
3.1. Preliminaries
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT). SFT trains the LLM
on curated query-output pairs to improve its instruction-
following ability. The aim of SFT is to maximize the fol-
lowing objective:
JSFT(θ)=E[q, o∼P(Q, O)]

1
|o|
|o|
X
t=1
log πθ(ot|q, o<t)

,
where q, o is the query-output pair sampled from the
SFT dataset P(Q, O), θ denotes the model parameters,
πθ(ot|q, o<t) represents the logit of the model predicting
the next token ot from q and previous tokens o<t.
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). GRPO cal-
culates the advantage ˆAi,t for the t-th token using the av-
erage reward of multiple sampled outputs, eliminating the
additional value function Vψ in PPO. Specifically, GRPO
samples a group of G outputs {o1, o2, ..., oG} from the old
model πθold, then optimizes the model by maximizing the
following objective (min & clip operations omitted here):
JGRPO(θ) = E[q ∼P(Q), {oi}G


,
where DKL[πθ||πref] serves as a regularization term that
prevents the new model πθ from deviating too far from the
3

original model πref (the model before training). As an ORM
method, GRPO provides the reward ri at the end of each
output oi (ri = 1 if the reasoning result is correct, otherwise
ri = 0), and sets the advantage ˆAi,t of all tokens in oi as the
normalized reward (r = {r1, r2, ..., rG}, mean(·) denotes
the average, and std(·) denotes the standard deviation):
ˆAi,t = ˜ri = ri −mean(r)
std(r)
.

Task-Specific Rewards.
This work applies Syn-GRPO
to three types of visual perception tasks (REC, OVD, and
ISR) (Figure 4), each with a task-specific accuracy reward.
REC (Referring Expression Comprehension) aims to lo-
calize the object in an image from a given referring expres-
sion. Following VLM-R1 [22], denote q, o as the query-
output pair, bgt as the ground-truth bounding box, frec(o)
as the predicted bounding box extracted from o, and IoU(·)
as the intersection-over-union metric, then the accuracy re-
ward Rrec
acc(o) for REC is calculated as:
Rrec
acc(o) = IoU(bgt, frec(o)).
(2)
OVD (Open-Vocabulary Object Detection) aims to de-
tect the objects in the image and output the corresponding
bounding boxes and class labels. Following VLM-R1 [22],
denote ˆbgt = {(bgt
i , cgt
i )}Ngt
i=1 as the list of N gt ground-truth
bounding-boxes and class labels, fovd(o) = {(bi, ci)}Npred
i=1
as the list of N pred predicted bounding-boxes and class la-
bels, and mAP(·) as the mean average precision metric,
then the accuracy reward Rovd
acc (o) for OVD is calculated
as (sovd aims to penalizes redundant predictions):

ISR (Indoor Scene Refinement) refines the indoor scene
based on top-view rendering images to enhance its aesthetic
quality. This work decomposes ISR into two stages: per-
ception and refinement, with Syn-GRPO applied in the first
stage. Specifically, the perception stage equals OVD, with
ISR’s accuracy reward Risr
acc(o) identical to Rovd
acc (o). More
details about ISR are in §2.2 of the appendix.
3.2. Data Quality Analysis
Although current RL methods have significantly enhanced
MLLM perception ability, they suffer from the problem of
low data quality. Low data quality refers to data samples
failing to elicit diverse responses from MLLMs, thereby
constraining the exploration space in MLLM RL. To inves-
tigate this problem, this work examines the entropy and
diversity of MLLM during GRPO training.
Entropy quantifies the predictability or randomness in-
herent in the tokens predicted by the LLM. Following Clip-
Cov & KL-Cov [4], the entropy H(q) corresponding to sam-
REC

and ISR) with the bounding box annotations.
ple q is calculated as the average of the entropy of each pre-
dicted token (note that πθ denotes the model):
H(q) = −E{oi}G
i=1∼πθ(O|q) [log πθ(oi,t|q, oi,<t)]

i=1

Eoi,t∼πθ(O|q) [log πθ(oi,t|q, oi,<t)] .
Diversity measures the extent to which an MLLM gen-
erates diverse responses for each sample, quantified by the
variance of the accuracy rewards Racc(oi) across G re-
sponses. Let var(·) denote the variance, then the diversity
V(q) corresponding to sample q is calculated as:
V(q) = var

{Racc(oi)}G
i=1

.
(4)
In practice, each metric is averaged over the samples in
the training batch. As shown in Figure 2, MLLM exhibits
entropy collapse and diversity collapse in the visual percep-
tion task (REC), characterized by a rapid decline in both en-
tropy and diversity during GRPO training. Entropy collapse
and diversity collapse indicate that the current visual per-
ception datasets are low-quality, exhibiting overly uniform
formatting, which constrains the RL exploration space.
3.3. Syn-GRPO
To tackle the low-quality data problem, this work proposes
Syn-GRPO (Synthesis-GRPO), which utilizes an online
data generator to adaptively synthesize high-quality training
data with diverse responses along with the GRPO training.
As shown in Figure 3, Syn-GRPO consists of two compo-
nents: (1) data server; (2) GRPO workflow.
3.3.1. Data Server
Previous data synthesis methods use advanced LLMs (e.g.,
GPT) to generate new text responses from existing images
without modifying the images. The proposed data server,
the first to overcome image-modality data limitations, lever-
ages an image-outpainting model to create new images via
original images and new image descriptions. To accom-
modate visual perception tasks and enhance training effi-
ciency, this data server incorporates two key features: (1)
foreground consistency and (2) decoupled design.
4

Foreground consistency. In data synthesis for RL, it
is essential to ensure the accuracy of labels in the synthe-
sized data. Therefore, to preserve visual perception task
labels, the data server masks out image regions beyond the
ground-truth bounding boxes and then employs an outpaint-
ing model to generate new images according to the new
image descriptions. Besides, the data server also employs
a foreground segmentation model to more accurately re-
move the background. As shown in Figure 5, the labels
(i.e., bounding boxes) for visual perception tasks remain
unchanged in the new images, ensuring their correctness.
Furthermore, by modifying the original image instead of
generating one from scratch, the data server can reduce dis-
crepancies between new and old data distributions.
Decoupled design. The data server adopts a modular de-
sign decoupled from the GRPO workflow, implemented via
Python’s HTTPServer package. Through a unified com-
munication API, the GRPO workflow requests data genera-
tion from the data server with the generation parameters and
receives the results upon completion. The decoupled design
enables asynchronous execution of GRPO training and data
generation, enhancing training efficiency. Moreover, this
design readily supports future extensions to other forms of
data synthesis, promoting our method’s generalization.
3.3.2. GRPO workflow
The GRPO workflow builds upon the original GRPO with
three key modifications: (1) New image description, (2)
Diversity reward, and (3) Description selection.
New image description.
In addition to the original
reasoning process and final answer, the GRPO workflow
prompts the MLLM to predict a text description for gen-
erating a new high-quality image (with diverse responses)
from the input image. Specifically, during GRPO training,
the MLLM generates G responses {oi}G
i=1 for each sample
q, with each oi containing a distinct new image description
di to form the set {di}G
i=1.
Diversity reward.
However, the generated samples
from the predicted image descriptions {di}G
i=1 do not en-
sure highly diverse responses. Thus, this work proposes a
diversity reward to supervise the MLLM in distinguishing
whether input samples elicit diverse responses, thereby en-
couraging it to learn image descriptions associated with
such diversity. To this end, the diversity reward is calcu-
lated by comparing the predicted diversity with the ground-
truth diversity. Specifically, the predicted diversity vi of
each response oi is generated by the MLLM and lies in the
range [0, 1]. Next, the ground-truth diversity V(q) for each
sample q is calculated as the variance of accuracy rewards
across G responses (Equation 4). Besides, V(q) is normal-
ized to the range of [0, 1] for the convenience of compar-
ison, using its original upper bound 1
4 as a reference (see
§1 of the appendix). Consequently, the diversity reward
Rdiversity(oi) of the i-th response oi is calculated as:
Rdiversity(oi) = 1 −|vi −V(q)|.
(5)
Moreover, this work identifies a diversity drift problem:
the ground-truth diversity of the model evolves with train-
ing; thus, the predicted diversity of the current model is
generated for the prior model as it is supervised by the
ground-truth diversity of the prior model. Given the over-
all declining trend in diversity (Figure 2), this work pro-
poses a diversity smoothing method that mitigates this is-
sue by calibrating the diversity of each training batch us-
ing an exponential moving average of historical diversity.
Specifically, let Bk denote the training batch at the k-th step,
β ∈[0, 1] denote the smooth weight, Vbatch avg
k
denote the
average diversity of Bk, Vglobal avg
k
denote the moving aver-
age of diversity at the k-th step, then the smoothed ground-
truth diversity ˜V(q) for sample q at the k-th step is calcu-
lated as (note that clip(·) clamps a value to a range):

Note that Vglobal avg

. The diversity smoothing method aligns
the current model’s diversity distribution with the previ-
ous one through the ratio of Vglobal avg
k
and Vbatch avg
k
, en-
hancing reward training accuracy and stability. Finally, the
updated diversity reward Rdiversity(oi) is calculated as in
Equation 6, which also lies in the range [0, 1].
Rdiversity(oi) = 1 −|vi −˜V(q)|.
(6)
Therefore, the final reward ri for the i-th response
oi is calculated as the summation of its accuracy reward
Racc(oi), format reward Rformat(oi), and diversity reward
Rdiversity(oi). Note that Rformat(oi) supervises oi to incor-
porate the reasoning process, predicted diversity, new image
description, and the final answer.
ri = Racc(oi) + Rformat(oi) + Rdiversity(oi).
(7)
Description selection. For the G new image descrip-
tions {di}G
i=1 derived from the MLLM-generated responses
{oi}G
i=1, the GRPO workflow requires selecting one for
transmission to the data server. To this end, this work selects
the image description with the highest Rdiversity(oi), as this
response more accurately assesses the diversity of answers
for the input q, leading to a more accurate image descrip-
tion for the new image with diverse responses. Specifically,

4. Experiments
Implementation details. Following existing MLLM per-
ception methods (e.g., VLM-R1 [22], Visionary-R1 [25],
and SATORI-R1 [21]), we conduct the main experiments
using Qwen2.5-VL-3B [1] and Qwen2.5-VL-7B [1] as base
models.
This work implements Syn-GRPO on the verl
framework [23], leveraging the vLLM engine [9] for RL
rollout acceleration and FSDP [32] for distributed training.
In the data server, the image-outpainting model is a Con-
trolNet [29] based on the SDXL [18] model, and the fore-
ground segmentation model is BEN2 (Background Erase
Network) [17].
For all three types of visual perception
tasks, we adopt the AdamW optimizer [14] to train the
model for 5 epochs, with a learning rate of 1 × 10−6, a
batch size of 20, and a rollout number G of 6. Besides, we
allocate 4 GPUs for the GRPO workflow, and 1 GPU for the
data server. The hyper-parameter γ in the diversity reward
is set to 0.7, as validated by ablation experiments.
Training datasets. For the REC task, we follow VLM-
R1 to use the RefCOCO & RefCOCO+ & RefCOCOg
datasets [16, 27] for training. Specifically, we randomly se-

lect 2,000 samples from their training sets and train for 5
epochs (resulting in 10,000 sample updates), which is com-
parable to VLM-R1’s total training budget of 9,600 sam-
ples. For the OVD task, we also follow VLM-R1 to use the
D3 dataset [26] for training, and randomly select 2,000 sam-
ples likewise. For the ISR task, we utilize the 3D-FRONT
dataset [5] for training, and randomly select 2,000 samples.
Test datasets.
For the REC task, following VLM-R1,
we evaluate on out-of-domain data (the test set of LISA-
Grounding [10]) and in-domain data (validation sets of Re-
fCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg). For the OVD task,
we also follow VLM-R1 to evaluate on the COCOfilter
dataset [11], a filtered subset derived from the COCO vali-
dation set. For the ISR task, we randomly select 500 sam-
ples from the 3D-FRONT dataset for evaluation.
Evaluation Metric. For the REC task, we follow VLM-R1
and calculate the accuracy as the ratio of predicted bound-
ing boxes with IoU > 0.5 relative to the ground-truth box.
For the OVD task and the perception stage of ISR task, we

GP (Greedy Precision), and GR (Greedy Recall) for eval-
uation. Specifically, GP is the fraction of predicted boxes
that match any ground-truth box, while GR is the reverse.
For the refinement stage of ISR task, we employ Sbbox and
Srotation to evaluate the refinement quality, assessing object
position and rotation, respectively. More details about GP,
GR, Sbbox, and Srotation are in §2.3 of the appendix.
4.1. Comparison Analysis
REC. Table 1 demonstrates the performance comparison of
different methods on the REC task, evaluated with two base
MLLMs: Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B. Several
conclusions can be drawn from Table 1.
(1) In the upper portion of the table, RL methods with
entropy constraints (Entropy Loss, Entropy Adv.) partially
mitigate entropy collapse, preserving exploration capacity
on low-quality data. However, they fail to fundamentally
resolve the core data quality issue, yielding only marginal
improvements over GRPO.
(2) In the lower portion of the table, GRPO underper-
forms VLM-R1, attributed to its utilization of fewer training
samples (2,000 versus 9,600).
(3) In the lower portion of the table, Syn-GRPO outper-
forms both standard RL methods, entropy-based methods,
and the offline generation method (using the descriptions
from GPT-4o) by synthesizing high-quality data through a
self-evolutionary mechanism.
(4) Syn-GRPO exhibits more pronounced performance
gains on out-of-domain data (LISA-Grounding) than on
in-domain benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and Re-
fCOCOg), as the synthesized data spans a broader, more
comprehensive distribution, endowing the MLLM with
more robust and comprehensive perception abilities.
OVD & ISR. Table 2 and Table 3 show that Syn-GRPO
also surpasses GRPO in these two visual perception tasks.
Moreover, the performance gain is more pronounced on
OVD than on ISR, as the training and test datasets in OVD
are out-of-domain, whereas those in ISR are in-domain.
Furthermore, experiments in §2.5 of the appendix demon-
strate that Syn-GRPO also enhances the performance of the
refinement stage (i.e., second stage) of ISR.

4.2. Ablation Experiments
This section presents ablation studies of Syn-GRPO: (1)
Variations in entropy & diversity; (2) Effect of data size;
(3) Diversity smoothing; (4) Asynchronous data synthesis.
Variations in entropy & diversity. As shown in Figure 2,
during the original GRPO training, the entropy and diversity
of the MLLM exhibit a rapid decreasing trend. By contrast,
Syn-GRPO sustains high entropy and diversity from the first
epoch (20% training progress), substantially mitigating the
issues of entropy collapse and diversity collapse using the
newly generated samples.
Effect of data size. This experiment varies data size (400
to 2,000 samples) in the REC task, investigating the im-
pact of data size on model performance. As shown in Fig-
ure 6, Syn-GRPO performance displays a steady upward
trend with increasing data size, indicating a data scaling law
and suggesting strong potential for generalization to long-
term reinforcement learning.
Diversity smoothing.
This experiment verifies the ef-
fect of the diversity smoothing method on the proposed
diversity reward.
Figure 7 (a) demonstrates that, with
diversity smoothing, the diversity reward increases more
steadily (with reduced fluctuations).
Moreover, it also
shows that diversity smoothing leads to a more rapid in-
crease in the diversity reward. Figure 7 (b) presents that,
with diversity smoothing, the test accuracy increases more
rapidly and ultimately reaches a higher plateau. Overall,
these two figures verify that diversity smoothing effectively

aligns the current model’s diversity distribution with the
previous one, yielding a more accurate diversity reward and
enabling stable and precise training. Furthermore, Table 4
shows that performance improves with initial increases in γ
but degrades when γ is excessively large, as it restricts the
update of smoothed diversity.
Asynchronous data synthesis. Table 5 shows that the syn-
chronous data server design nearly doubles training time
versus the original GRPO, as it must generate new data
for each batch before proceeding. To tackle this problem,
the data server adopts a modular design decoupled from
the GRPO workflow, enabling asynchronous data synthesis
with negligible overhead, as shown in Table 5.
4.3. Visualization Analysis
Visualization of generated images. Figure 5 presents ex-
amples of generated images for three types of visual per-
ception tasks. These visualizations show that the generated
images possess high image fidelity and foreground consis-
tency, thereby ensuring the accuracy of labels for the new
data and satisfying the requirements for RL training.
Trends in generated images. Figure 8 illustrates the gen-
erated images from the same original image at various
epochs, highlighting their increasing complexity and dif-
ficulty, thereby preserving the diversity in reinforcement
learning. This phenomenon demonstrates Syn-GRPO’s po-
tential for adapting to long-term scalable RL by generating
increasingly challenging images throughout RL training.
Surreal generated images. We observe an intriguing phe-
nomenon wherein the MLLM occasionally generates sur-

Figure 9. Although these images do not exist in reality,
they hold potential to benefit RL training by stimulating the
MLLM’s reasoning capability through eliciting novel rea-
soning pathways from new perspectives.
Visualization w/ & w/o Syn-GRPO. Figure 10 demon-
strates that, in contrast to GRPO, Syn-GRPO accurately lo-
calizes a partially occluded recreational vehicle. This in-
dicates that Syn-GRPO enhances the MLLM’s perception
ability under challenging conditions such as object occlu-
sion and complex backgrounds, by synthesizing a large vol-
ume of high-quality, complex training data.
Furthermore, we have provided more visualization anal-
ysis in §3 of the appendix.
5. Conclusion
In this work, we provide a thorough analysis of the low-
quality data problem in RL for MLLM perception, where
data samples fail to elicit diverse responses from MLLMs,
thereby limiting the exploration scope for RL. To tackle
this problem, we propose Syn-GRPO (Synthesis-GRPO),
which utilizes an online data generator to synthesize high-
quality training data with diverse responses in GRPO train-
ing. Specifically, Syn-GRPO consists of a data server and
a GRPO workflow.
The data server leverages an image
generation model to synthesize new samples with an asyn-
chronous design. The GRPO workflow provides new image
descriptions to the server and proposes a diversity reward,

supervising the MLLM to predict descriptions for high-
quality images with diverse responses. Experimental results
across three visual perception tasks indicate that Syn-GRPO
substantially enhances data quality, significantly outper-
forming existing RL methods. We hope our framework can
contribute to the community of MLLM reasoning.
