Abstract— The task of weed detection is an essential element of 
precision agriculture since accurate species identification allows 
a farmer to selectively apply herbicides and fits into sustainable 
agriculture crop management. This paper proposes a hybrid 
deep learning framework recipe for weed detection that utilizes 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers 
(ViTs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build robustness 
to multiple field conditions. A Generative Adversarial Network 
(GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance 
class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a 
self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn 
more features from limited annotated data. Experimental 
results yield superior results with 99.33% accuracy, precision, 
recall, and F1-score on multi-benchmark datasets. The 
proposed model architecture enables local, global, and 
relational 
feature 
representations 
and 
offers 
high 
interpretability and adaptability. Practically, the framework 
allows real-time, efficient deployment to edge devices for 
automated weed detecting, reducing over-reliance on herbicides 
and providing scalable, sustainable precision-farming options.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Weed infestation is one of the most challenging issues in 
modern agriculture, which causes enormous crop yield loss, 
lowers crop quality and exacerbates dependency on chemical 
herbicides [1]. Research shows that uncontrolled weed growth 
could reduce crop yield by up to 34 percent, which poses an 
enormous threat to food security and economic sustainability 
globally [2]. Traditional approaches for weed management, 
like manual weeding, mechanical cultivation and broadcast 
herbicides, while commonly practiced, are also deemed 
unsustainable with all the growing issues of being labor-
intensive, operationally defective and environmentally 
unfriendly [3]-[4]. More importantly, excessive use of 
herbicides raises production costs; induces herbicide 
resistance as well as soil erosion, and pollution of nearby 
ecosystems that poses a significant risk to biodiversity and 
agricultural sustainability [5]. 
Precision agriculture has emerged in response to these 
limitations as a paradigm shift that could be used to enhance 
efficiency of resource consumption and lessen environmental 
impact. Recently, crop fields can be monitored with fine grain 
using artificial intelligence (AI), unmanned aerial vehicles 
(UAVs), and computer vision technology to provide timely 
scouting and precision intervention for weed control [6], [7]. 
The potential of image-based weed detection with machine 
learning and deep learning models is one avenue that has been 
showing much promise. More specifically, convolutional 
neural networks (CNNs) have shown to be very successful in 
using hierarchical visual features for crops and weeds called 
"distinguished" when settings are controlled in the lab [8]. 
However, viewed in real world settings, CNNs tend to show 
sub optimal performance due to changes in lightning 
conditions, occlusions, adverse soil texture and complicated 
canopy geometries [9]. In addition to model optimization, 
CNNs are also usually trained in a supervised fashion and 
require large, labeled datasets to be successful, which 
generally requires considerable resources to assemble in 
agriculture fields with often limited availability of expert 
annotation [10]. 
Besides limitations of the dataset, CNN-based systems 
currently have a major difficulty extrapolating across 
heterogeneous field environments. Such systems encompass 
large external variability in lighting, occlusion, and soil 
texture, while struggling to model global contextual 
dependencies to differentiate morphologically similar plant 
species. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently indicated 
potential to model long range spatial relationships via self-
attention, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are able to 
model structural and topological dependencies between 
features [11].  
Problem Statement: Overall, however, most of the current 
weed detection approaches remain based on CNNs with 
single-task learning objectives, yielding limited adaptability 
and interpretability for practical use in agriculture. There is a 
lack of representative field data (which is natch scarce), 
extreme class imbalance of weed species, and NN models 
require an extreme amount of computational resources, 
typically prohibiting their transfer to deployment on UAVs or 
autonomous weeding robots. The need for a unified and data-
efficient and generalizable deep-learning framework is 
apparent to effectively model local, global and relational 
features in data while maintaining the light weight 
performance for edge device inference. 

 
 
To solve these problems, this study introduces a hybrid 
deep learning pipeline that brings together CNN, ViT, and 
GNN modules under a self-supervised, multi-task learning 
framework. More specifically, the model performs contrastive 
pretraining to harness unlabeled field data and GAN-based 
augmentation to synthetically augment the number of 
minority weed classes. Unlike traditional single-task 
frameworks, the multi-task learning framework jointly 
classifies weeds, segment the image semantically, and 
estimate the growth stage of target weeds—all of which 
provide an edge-optimized, sustainable, to easily scalable 
solution for smart weed management in precision agriculture. 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
Traditional weed control practices, including hand 
weeding, tillage, and the broad application of herbicides, are 
still commonplace while being associated with significant 
labor, economic and environmental costs [18], [23]. In 
general, these methods indirectly lead to soil erosion, 
pollution of water resources and reliance on a practice that is 
undermining sustainable agriculture [1], [5]. Computational 
weed management began with initial studies proposing 
machine learning classifiers with hand crafted features 
(histograms of gradients and accelerated robust features for 
weed classification) that yield moderate performance for 
intelligent robotic spraying systems [1], [12]. 
Deep learning has since become a leading paradigm of 
crop weed recognition. CNN-based models, such as ResNet 
and DarkNet, have been shown to be very precise in 
distinguishing weeds species both in controlled and field 
environments [2], [3]. Combined with object detection 
systems like YOLO and Faster R-CNN, site-specific herbicide 
spraying and robotic actuation has been made possible [7], 
[14], [15]. Creating datasets is a bottleneck, and large 
annotated data sets such as aerial imagery of monocot and 
dicot weeds are better at training models and generalization 
[7]. Nevertheless, the variability in the backgrounds, 
overlapping species, and the changes in illumination continue 
to decrease model robustness [20]. 
To address these limitations, hybrid and advanced 
architectures have been presented. Graph convolutional 
networks (GCNs) with CNN features demonstrated high 
recognition accuracy when using limited labeled data due to 
their relational modelling ability between weeds and crops [6]. 
The semi-supervised and transfer learning methods have 
minimized the need of annotation and yet they retain high 
performance [9], [16]. Thin models that combine attention 
mechanisms and spatial pooling modules have also enhanced 
both the speed and ability of the inference to resist 
environmental variation [3], [19]. The reviews confirm that 
robots in weeding systems and autonomous platforms are fast 
developing with the integration of computer vision and deep 
learning [13], [17], [22]. 
Recent literature indicates that multispectral and UAV-
based imaging can be used to detect weeds at an early stage to 
aid in real-time decision-making and minimize the use of 
chemicals [12], [19], [21]. Better architectures like WeedDet 
and YOLO-CBAM have demonstrated higher accuracy and 
efficiency in the more challenging case of paddy and invasive 
weed and complex scenarios [15], [21]. Surveys stress edge-
ready deployment, domain adaptation, and real-time 
optimization to translate research into viable agricultural 
systems [8], [9]. 
Despite these developments, the available literature is 
largely based on single-model CNNs or shallow hybrids, 
with a common emphasis on classification or detection 
alone. Very few discuss integration of multi-task learning, 
transformer-based global reasoning, and relational 
modeling using GNNs in a single pipeline. In addition, 
generative model-based augmentation methods are under-
investigated in agricultural data. This work closes this gap 
by suggesting a holistic model that integrates CNNs, ViTs, 
GNNs, and GAN-based augmentation with self-supervised 
learning, maximized to run in real time on a robot. 
III. DATA AND METHODOLGY 
A. Dataset Description 
The dataset of this research is the Soybean-Weed UAV 
Dataset [1] that consists of 15,336 images taken and captured 
by the UAVs and classified into four categories: soybean 
(48%), soil (21%), grass weeds (23%), and broadleaf weeds 
(8%). The photos have been taken in natural field conditions, 
which introduced a difference in the intensity of light, soil 
and plant morphology. The data is characterized by high 
levels of class imbalance; especially on broadleaf weed which 
is a challenge to traditional classifiers. To address this 
constraint, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are used 
to create more samples of underrepresented classes to balance 
the dataset and enhance the generalization of a model. Figure 
1 shows the distribution of classes across soybean, soil, grass 
weeds, and broadleaf weeds representative of the class 
imbalance problem, which supports employing GAN-based 
augmentation for better class balance. 
 
Fig. 1. Class label distribution across soybean, soil, grass weeds, and 
broadleaf weeds. Imbalance in broadleaf weeds motivates GAN-based 
augmentation for improved representation. 
B. Data Preprocessing and Augmentation 
All raw UAV images are processed through a 
standardized pipeline, which includes resizing to 224 x 224, 
normalization of raw images to zero mean, unit variance and 
denoising with a 3 x 3 median filter. To reduce illumination 
discrepancies, adaptive histogram equalization and gamma 
correction is used. In addition to the traditional geometric 
augmentation, including flips and rotations, this work 
presents GAN-based augmentation, which produces realistic 
synthetic images with variations in the crop-weed patterns, 
soil texture, and lighting conditions. This will guarantee that 
the model acquires the strength of features in diverse 
development stages, geographical locations, and ecological 
elements, which increases the originality of the preprocessing 

 
 
pipeline. Figure 2 depicts the preprocessing pipeline, 
showing the UAV original samples, the denoised outputs, and 
the enhancement of the dataset with images from the GAN 
that contributed to dataset diversity and balance across weed 
categories.

median filtered samples to eliminate noise; (bottom row) beta and gamma-
corrected samples to boost contrast and brightness. The steps showcase the 
importance of the denoising and intensity adjustments in preparing leaf data 
to be used in additional analyses. 
C. Hybrid Deep Learning Backbone 
 
The suggested hybrid backbone consists of combination of 
Convolutional 
Neural 
Networks 
(CNNs), 
Vision 
Transformers (ViTs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to 
simultaneously model the local textures, global dependencies 
and spatial relational aspects of each UAV field image. Each 
of these elements contribute to one another to derive a full 
representation that is both discriminative and context aware 
characterization for UAV field imagery. 
Assume the input UAV image is represented by 𝐼∈ℝ𝐻×𝑊×3. 
CNN module (MobileNetV2 and VGG-16) distills hierarchies 
of spatial features: 
𝐹𝐶𝑁𝑁= 𝑓𝐶𝑁𝑁(𝐼)
(1) 
These characteristics convey differences in fine-grained 
edges, textures and shapes that are important in distinguishing 
crops from weed structure. However, CNNs do not encode 
long-range dependencies over portions of the field that are far 
away from each other.  
To address this, Vision Transformer (ViT) uses non-
overlapping patches of the same image to learn contextual 
connections overall. The picture is partitioned into 𝑁 patches, 
linearly projected into an embedding 𝐸𝑖: 
𝐸𝑖= 𝑊𝐸⋅Flatten(𝑃𝑖) + 𝐸𝑝𝑜𝑠,𝑖,  𝑖= 1,2, … , 𝑁
(2) 
𝑊𝐸 is the learnable embedding matrix, and 𝐸𝑝𝑜𝑠 is positional 
encodings. The ViT uses multi-head self-attention on these 
embeddings: 
𝐹𝑉𝑖𝑇= MSA(𝐸) = Softmax (𝑄𝐾𝑇
√𝑑𝑘
) 𝑉
(3) 
𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉 the embedding projections for queries, keys, and 
values, and 𝑑𝑘 the head dimensionality. This allows the 
network to establish relationships between patches separated 
by distance, thereby facilitating a more scale-invariant 
understanding of vegetation patterns.  
The Graph Neural Network (GNN) is used to model the 
topological relationships between identified plant areas. Each 
area can be thought of as a node, 𝑣𝑖, and the distance in space 
or visual proximity can be thought of as the edge. The 
propagation of features in a graph form is called: 
ℎ𝑖
(𝑙+1) = 𝜎( ∑𝐴𝑖𝑗
𝑗∈𝒩(𝑖)
𝑊(𝑙)ℎ𝑗
(𝑙))
(4) 
In which 𝐴𝑖𝑗 is the adjacency matrix, 𝑊(𝑙)  is the weight 
matrix at layer 𝑙, and 𝜎 is a non-linear activation. The 
resulting representation preserves plant-level and contextual 
field information: 
𝐹𝐺𝑁𝑁= 𝑓𝐺𝑁𝑁(𝐹𝑉𝑖𝑇)
(5) 
Lastly, the outputs of all three modules are joined and 
projected into a single latent space in a linear fashion. 
𝐹𝐻𝑦𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑑 =  𝑊𝐻[𝐹𝐶𝑁𝑁 || 𝐹𝑉𝑖𝑇 || 𝐹𝐺𝑁𝑁]
(6) 
This hybrid representation combines multi-level and multi-
scale features, such as local leaf texture to global field 
geometry, which deal with the shortcomings of single-
architecture 
networks 
and 
guarantee 
more 
robust 
generalization across a variety of agricultural environments. 
D. Attention-Based Feature Fusion   
The hybrid representations are improved with a channel 
attention module, dynamically focusing on the most 
informative channels. The features from CNN and ViT are 
concatenated first. 
𝐹= [𝐹𝐶𝑁𝑁 || 𝐹𝑉𝑖𝑇] 
(7) 
The channel attention module calculates the weight 
significance of each feature map in the following way: 
𝑤𝑐= 𝜎(𝑊2 ⋅ReLU(𝑊1 ⋅GAP(𝐹)))
(8) 
In which GAP(⋅) represents global average pooling, 𝑊1 and 
𝑊2 are matrices to be learnt and  is the Sigmoid. The 
recalibrated feature map is derived by: 
𝐹′ = 𝑤𝑐⊙𝐹
(9) 
⊙ is element-wise multiplication. The sophisticated attention-
weighted feature is then combined with the relational 
embedding of the GNN: 
𝐹𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙= 𝜙([𝐹′ || 𝐹𝐺𝑁𝑁])
(10) 
In this case , 𝜙(⋅) is a transformation operator that rotates the 
combined embeddings into a unified feature representation. 
The output feature matrix represents the local detail, global 
context, and relationships that enhance discrimination of the 
similar vegetation types in cluttered backgrounds. 

 
 
The conjoining is attention-attuned such that the integration of 
texture, structure, and spatial context suits the hybrid 
network's attention mechanism. The architecture is quite 
robust in drawing on and focusing on salient cues while 
inhibiting extraneous activations, which is a very important 
issue to real-life UAV-based weed detection.

which selectively highlights important local and global cues before instava 
labelling for use in GNN embeddings to incresase relational learning. 
E. Multi-Task Learning Framework 
The 
proposed 
model 
uses 
multi-task 
learning 
to 
simultaneously learn and optimize the three tasks of 
classifying weeds and crops, semantic segmentation, and 
predicting the growth stage, unlike the traditional methods 
that only utilize classification. The overall loss model is as 
follows: 
𝐿total = 𝛼𝐿cls + 𝛽𝐿seg + 𝛾𝐿growth
(11) 
where 𝐿cls  is the categorical cross-entropy loss for 
classification, 𝐿seg is the Dice loss for segmentation, and 
𝐿growth is the mean squared error for growth stage regression. 
Coefficients α, β, and γ control the relative contribution of 
each task. Concurrently acquiring several goals, the model 
acquires 
complementary 
information 
and 
enhances 
generalization and a deeper comprehension of the field 
conditions.

G. Validation and Interpretabilty 
5-fold stratified cross-validation is used to evaluate the 
model. Measures consist of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-
score and mean IoU of segmentation. Grad-CAM++ 
heatmaps and attention visualizations are produced to 
emphasize areas of impact on predictions to make it 
interpretable to be practically deployed. The step underlines 
reliability, which is a prohibitively important novelty to the 
real-life use of agriculture. 
H. System Overveiw 
The end-to-end pipeline integrates UAV data acquisition, 
preprocessing, GAN augmentation, hybrid CNN–ViT–GNN 
backbone, multi-task heads, and edge deployment. This 
modular framework emphasizes novelty at every stage, 
combining 
generative 
augmentation, 
self-supervised 
learning, multi-architecture fusion, multi-task supervision, 
and deployment optimization in one system.

CNN–ViT–GNN framework that shows the integration of UAV data 
acquisition, preprocessing, GAN-based augmentation, hybrid backbone, and

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Experimental Setup and Parameters 
The proposed framework was developed in TensorFlow 
2.12 with CUDA 12.1 acceleration on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 
GPU with 24 GB of VRAM. The analysis was conducted on 
the soybean–weed UAV dataset, which includes 15,336 
images collected in natural field conditions from four classes: 
soybean, soil, grass weed, and broadleaf weed. All images 
underwent resizing to 224×224 pixels and normalization 
prior to the onset of training. The CNN backbone utilized 
MobileNetV2, with weights initialized with ImageNet pre-
training, and the Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) utilized 
16×16 patch embeddings and utilized a 12-head self-attention 
module. The GNN used a 2-layer Graph Convolutional 
Network (GCN) with 64 hidden units and 128 hidden units in 
a sequential architecture. Training was performed for 100 
epochs with the Adam optimizer (learning rate = 1×10⁻⁴, 
batch size = 32) with loss of categorical cross-entropy to 
represent 
classification, 
segmentation, 
and 
growth 
estimation, weighted in a ratio of 0.5:0.3:0.2 respectively, and 
with loss weight added for acentric segmentation instances. 
GAN augmentation used a conditional DCGAN with a 128-
point latent vector that was trained for 50 epochs. The final 
model was quantized for 8-bit precision for edge deployment 
on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier module.  
 
B. Model Performance 
The proposed hybrid deep learning architecture was 
stringently tested on the soybean- weed UAV dataset that 
consists of four different classes: Broadleaf, Grass, Soil, 
Soybean. The model was shown to be highly effective with 
an overall accuracy of 99.33, with the class-wise precision, 
recall, and F1-scores always being greater than 0.98. These 
findings suggest that a network can capture fine-grained local 
textures as well as large scale contextual information by its 
multi-branch structure, and thus it is able to distinguish 
between similar classes with high confidence. Broadleaf, 
Soil, and Soybean, as shown in Table I, the proposed model 
achieves near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-scores across 
all weed and crop classes, confirming its strong 
discriminative ability in complex field conditions. Although 
the precision of Grass was a bit lower at 0.98, it still reached 
perfect recall, meaning that the model is reliable to classify 
all Grass cases but makes some mistakes with a few samples 
pertaining to the other classes.

The efficacy of the proposed framework can be attributed 
to its multi-branch hybrid design, which integrates 
convolutional layers for local spatial information extraction 
with attention-based functionalities for establishing long-
range networks. The multi-branch architecture differs from a 
typical CNN architecture because this architecture will 
ensure the loss of fine textures is less likely and the global 
context content is retained, as usual CNNs could be over 
biased to local patterning. It also addresses complementary 
feature fusion layers to allow the appropriate information of 
each branch to be fused into the model to enhance and ease 
the separation of classes. Overall, the results demonstrate the 
robustness and generalizability of the proposed framework 
which demonstrates valid applicability to meet the 
requirements of leading an accurate automated-monitoring 
application within an agricultural context. 
The confusion matrix provided in Fig. 7 further 
demonstrates the reasonable performance, where the majority 
of the predictions fall on in the diagonally line, with minimal 
misclassification. The results also show the reliability of the 
model in distinguishing crops and weeds in a visually 
complex field setting. 
 
Fig. 5. The confusion matrix for our proposed weed detection framework 
displays robust diagonal dominance and limited confusion between classes 
indicating strong classification performance across all weed classes. 
 
C. Learning Dynamics 
The learning method demonstrates consistent optimism in 
the training behavior of the framework. The accuracy trends 
increase to high values gradually without oscillations, and the 
loss is decreasing gradually until reaching a threshold. This 
suggests that the architecture has generalized even under 
environmental variability with no apparent overfitting issues 
described in the literature. The consideration for GAN-based 
augmentation incorporation function was important to 
maintain generalization throughout the training, while 

 
 
attention fusion and multi-task learning had been included to 
stabilize convergence. These design decisions were to ensure 
that the model reached a high final performance, and 
presented consistent training performance which allows for 
real-world applicability.  
In Fig. 8 accuracies history is illustrated where the 
training and validation accuracy increase steadily until 
plateauing at around 99%. The lack of separation between the 
two curves in the validation and training processes indicates 
that the network has generalized and is not overfitting. 
 
Fig. 6. In the previous set of figures, training and validation accuracy curves 
were plotted across epochs and showed stable convergence and consistent 
generalization with little overfitting, indicating good regularization of the 
model. 
 
In the same way, Fig. 9 shows the loss curves, where the 
training and validation losses follow a curve of a smooth 
decrease and level off. The fact that the curves are close 
together indicates that the learning process is highly 
regularized, which supports the benefit of integrating GAN-
based augmentation, attention fusion, and multi-task 
learning. These results confirm the stability of the pipeline 
when being trained with realistic variability of agricultural 
data. 
To demonstrate real-world applicability, the framework was 
tested on UAV -acquired imagery of diverse soybean field 
plots at varying illumination and soil conditions. Accuracy of 
the hybrid model remained above 98% accuracy for all 
conditions, demonstrating robustness to environmental 
changes. When using the quantized model on an NVIDIA 
Jetson Xavier edge device onboard the UAV prototype, the 
rate of inference speeds was 22 frames per second without a 
significant delay; confirming the model is good for 
implementation in a real-time, in-field operational capacity. 
These results substantiate the findings that the framework is 
prepared to assist in autonomous weed monitoring and 
robotic actuation in precision agriculture systems.

D. Comaparitive Evaluation 
Performance was compared to the previous weed 
detection methods that were reported in the literature to 
determine the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed 
framework. Past research has obtained accuracies between 91 
and 97.7 percent, with a moderate increase in precision and 
recall as indicated in TABLE II. Conversely, the proposed 
model had an accuracy of 99.33% and precision, recall and 
F1-scores that all met at 0.99.

This uniform high performance of all metrics might be 
explained by the hybrid backbone (CNN + ViT + GNN), the 
use of GAN-based data balancing, and the introduction of 
multi-task 
learning 
goals. 
This 
represents 
a 
great 
enhancement as compared to the traditional CNN-only 
pipelines, and the application of various deep learning 
paradigms to sustainably utilize agriculture is essential. 
E. Discussion 
 
The overall results validate the originality and usefulness 
of the suggested approach. Conventional CNN pipelines are 
typically limited to generalization across different field steps, 
eg. different lighting, soil texture, or weed fields. The hybrid 
design, in its turn, is effective to utilize the capabilities of the 

 
 
various deep learning paradigms: CNNs detect fine-grained 
spatial features, the Vision Transformer can model long-range 
relationships across the entire image, and GNNs model 
structural relationships among the various plant and soil 
characteristics. Such a multi-dimensional strategy allows the 
network to effectively detect small differences between crops 
and weeds, even in adverse conditions in the real world. 
 
Moreover, data augmentation and multi-tasking elements 
allow making sure that the model is not limited to one 
classification task but can be easily applied to related tasks like 
semantic segmentation, growth-stage estimation or yield 
prediction. These features allow the framework to be 
especially adapted to the integration into UAV platforms and 
autonomous robotic weeders, providing scalable solutions to 
the field monitoring. The system improves the accuracy of 
weed detection by about 99.95 percent, thus, not only 
increases the accuracy of weed detection but also facilitates 
sustainable agricultural practices by minimizing the number 
of herbicides used, increasing crop yield, and supporting 
ecologically responsible practices in farming. Together, these 
findings point to the scientific novelty and the translational 
promise of the framework in the application of precision 
agriculture to the real world. 
V. CONCLUSION 
   This research introduces a new hybrid deep learning 
framework that combines Convolutional Neural Networks 
(CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Graph Neural 
Networks (GNNs) for the objective of intelligent weed 
detection in precision agriculture. Capitalizing on self-
supervised 
contrastive 
pretraining 
and 
Generative 
Adversarial Network (GAN)-based data augmentation 
techniques, the proposed model addresses the challenges of a 
highly imbalanced dataset and limited labeled data, achieving 
an overall accuracy of 99.33% along with balanced precision, 
recall, and F-Score metrics as well. In the proposed hybrid 
architecture, weed classification, semantic segmentation, and 
growth-stage prediction are jointly performed, integrating 
fine-grained textural features and high-level spatial 
relationships in this technology to capture the intricacies of 
weed communities. Multi-task learning of several tasks, 
together with attention-based feature aggregation of 
contextualized CNN and ViT features, help achieve strong 
generalization in a diverse field sampling context. The 
quantized and pruned model output can also be easily pushed 
to the edge to allow for real-time inference on UAV and 
robotic weeders. In the practical realm that is precision 
agriculture, this can facilitate decreased chemical inputs 
through reduced herbicide input; increased yield of crops 
from effective weed removal by reduced out of field inputs; 
and 
sustainable 
resource 
management 
on 
farming 
ecosystems. High performance has been reported as part of 
the work, however, challenges may remain with factors of 
substantial occlusion or shifts in lighting conditions. Future 
work can continue components of this project by 
investigating multispectral UAV imagery, multi-seasonal 
crop datasets, and adapting to an active learning approach for 
incidental labeling. In summary, the hybrid model concept 
brings the ability of cognitive artificial intelligence to the 
field in a scalable, data-efficient approach that continues to 
support sustainable farming practices, and advance the 
possibility for intelligent autonomous and sustainable 
farming.
