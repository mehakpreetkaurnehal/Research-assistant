Abstract
Safety-critical assistive systems that directly decode user intent from neural signals
require rigorous guarantees of reliability and trust. We present GUARDIAN (Gated
Uncertainty-Aware Runtime Dual Invariants), a framework for real-time neuro-
symbolic verification for neural signal-controlled robotics. GUARDIAN enforces
both logical safety and physiological trust by coupling confidence-calibrated brain
signal decoding with symbolic goal grounding and dual-layer runtime monitoring.
On the BNCI2014 motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset with 9
subjects and 5,184 trials, the system performs at a high safety rate of 94–97%
even with lightweight decoder architectures with low test accuracies (27–46%) and
high ECE confidence miscalibration (0.22–0.41). We demonstrate ≈1.7x correct
interventions in simulated noise testing versus at baseline. The monitor operates
at 100Hz and sub-millisecond decision latency, making it practically viable for
closed-loop neural signal-based systems. Across 21 ablation results, GUARDIAN
exhibits a graduated response to signal degradation, and produces auditable traces
from intent, plan to action, helping to link neural evidence to verifiable robot action.

Introduction
Neural signal-controlled robots have significant potential to improve accessibility for individuals with
limited mobility but they also introduce important safety risks[32]. Maintaining runtime accuracy and
implementing reliable intervention mechanisms are paramount in closed-loop systems to ensure user
safety[6, 10, 17]. Recent closed-loop EEG-based assistive systems [23, 34] and AI-enabled brain-
computer interfaces (BCIs) [25] show encouraging progress, but remain vulnerable to ambiguous
user intent, a known challenge in shared autonomy and teleoperation[12, 19, 20]. They also suffer
signal degradation during long-horizon tasks[22, 27, 29, 31] and lack formal or interpretable safety
mechanisms like runtime assurance[6, 17], or shielding[7]. We propose GUARDIAN, a physiological
runtime verification architecture that provides an auditable, explainable layer between neural decoding
and execution. GUARDIAN acts as a safety gate that complements neurally-controlled systems,
producing tracing and intervention tooling without disrupting real-time operations.
Design principle and goals. GUARDIAN prioritizes the following principles: (a) conservative safety
(halting over execution when neural evidence is weak or contradictory), (b) interpretability (traceable
action chains from raw brain signal→intent→plan→action compatible with common symbolic
planning toolchains like PDDL [13]), (c) modularity (wraps any decoder with < 1ms overhead), and
(d) tunability (operators can set confidence thresholds informed by calibration analysis).
Threat model and scope. Our system operates with non-invasive neural signals in assistive robot
domains, oftentimes challenging due to noise interference, non-stationarity–within-session accuracy
drop and between-session variance, neural artifacts, and subject fatigue[9, 29]. We address confidence

miscalibration, where decoders show high confidence despite poor accuracy[15, 26]. When there are
no violations, our monitor gates actuation and operates under standard action safety protocols[2, 3, 5].
In assistive robotics, hardware can pose physical risks for users when there is uncontrolled device
activation or delayed shutdown[5, 6]. Attacks or adversary threats are outside our scope.
Contributions. We make the following contributions: (I) a safety-centric framework achieving high
safety rates under severe signal degradation, (II) a verifiable neuro-symbolic pipeline that formally
links EEG distributions to symbolic goals, and (III) a practical lightweight architecture with minute
computational overhead enabling deployable and trustworthy neural signal-based control.

GUARDIAN: Formalization and Algorithm
Figure 1: System architecture overview.
Let xt ∈RC×W denote the EEG window
at time t (C channels, W samples).
A
decoder fθ outputs a categorical poste-
rior pt ∈∆3 over the action set H =
{GRASP, RELEASE, MOVE_TO, ROTATE}
corresponding to left hand, right hand,
feet, and tongue motor imagery (MI),
respectively. These actions enable natural
control (positioning, grasping, releasing,
orienting) for EEG-based manipulation.
We treat pt as a 4-dimensional probability
vector over H, i.e., pt
∈∆3
⊂R4
(3-simplex).
Let u denote the uniform
distribution on H, i.e., u(h) =
1
|H| = 1

for all h ∈H. Unless stated otherwise, log
denotes the natural logarithm and 0 log 0 := 0.
Calibration-aware safety.
To mitigate the effects of miscalibration, we construct a calibrated intent
distribution by convexly mixing with the uniform prior ˜pt = αmpt + (1 −αm) u, αm ∈[0.5, 0.8],
where u is the uniform distribution on H. Since this is a convex combination, ˜pt ∈∆3. Epistemic
uncertainty is quantified using the normalized Shannon entropy

over the last K frames (K=10 at 100 Hz, K ≥2). To obtain a scalar artifact score comparable to a

denotes the z-scored root-mean-square amplitude of channel c within the [20, 45] Hz
band (dimensionless after z-scoring). Mean aggregation was empirically found to be robust. Note
that max-based aggregation may also be used with an appropriately tuned threshold τA.
Invariant types. Let τ = (τH, τA, τΩ) denote the physiological thresholds. We define physiological
invariants Ψ = {ψ1, ψ2, ψ3} and logical invariants Φ = {ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3} as ψ1 :
ˆH(˜pt) < τH,
ψ2 : At < τA, ψ3 : Ωt < τΩ, ϕ1 : objects reachable, ϕ2 : safe configurations, ϕ3 : valid transitions.
Decoder architectures. We evaluate four representative neural decoder architectures: EEGNet [24],
Riemannian covariance model [8], lightweight CNN [30] and an interpretable feature model (RealIn-
tent) each spanning 12k–45k parameters. See full architecture and training details in App. D.
Dual safety monitoring. The dual-layer monitor (See Alg. 2) checks physiological invariants Ψ
(lines 4–6), grounds intent to a symbolic goal (line 7), synthesizes it into a plan (line 8), and verifies

and maintains the current safe state IDLE. Note this is distinct from user-commanded actions in H.

Experimental Setup
Dataset. We evaluate on the BNCI2014 [18, 21] dataset, comprising of 9 subjects performing
4-class (left hand, right hand, feet, tongue) MI. EEG was sampled from 22 channels at 250Hz, and
band-pass filtered to [8, 30]Hz. Classes were mapped to manipulation primitives: left hand →GRASP,
right hand →RELEASE, feet →MOVE_TO, tongue →ROTATE over two sessions. Train / validation /
test splits followed chronological session boundaries to simulate realistic deployment scenarios.
Implementation. All models were implemented in PyTorch 2.0 [28] and raw EEG signals were
preprocessed with MNE-Python [14]. PDDL planning used the FastDownward algorithm [16].
Thresholds were αm=0.8 for EEGNet, 0.5 for Riemannian, 0.6 for other decoders, and τH=0.75
(normalized entropy), τA=2.5 (z), τΩ=0.3. Sensitivity analyses varied the entropy threshold τH ∈
[0.1, 0.9] with increments of 0.1, while keeping τA and τΩfixed. All experiments were conducted on
NVIDIA A100 GPU, Intel Xeon CPU hardware, at 100Hz and < 1ms latency.
Calibration metrics. Confidence calibration was evaluated with Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE) with standard binning [15]. See details outlined in App. F.
Metrics. Safety rate: percentage of correct intervention decisions, e.g. intervenes when decoder is
incorrect, allows when correct. Intervention rate: percentage of trials where the monitor forces IDLE.
Latency: wall-clock time from EEG input to the action output. See detailed formulation in App. I.

Decoder performance and validation-test
gap. Table 8 summarizes the performance
of the four decoder architectures tested. Val-
idation accuracies were comparable to stan-
dard MI decoding literature (50–60%) [8, 24,
30], but test-time performance degraded catas-
trophically to 27–46%, barely above 25%
chance level. The validation-test gap shows
a 20–30% performance drop, highlighting non-
stationarity and distribution shifts that are typ-
ically endemic to BCI systems.
Confidence calibration analysis. Severe miscalibration was revealed across decoders (Table 1). The
Riemannian decoder exhibited the highest miscalibration (ECE=0.410, MCE=0.906). The calibration-
accuracy gaps exemplify why confidence scores alone cannot be trusted for safety decisions.
Safety threshold sensitivity. Ablation studies across confidence thresholds (0.1–0.9) revealed
critical sensitivity in the safety-intervention tradeoff (See App. G.1). Single threshold-confidence
gating is known to be brittle under miscalibration [15]. Safety-optimal thresholds (0.816–0.900) are
necessarily conservative, and required 68–87% intervention rates in order to achieve adequate safety.
3

This validates our multi-layer checking approach, as solely relying on confidence thresholding would
require either accepting low safety rates or performing excessive interventions.
Safety monitoring performance. Dual-invariant safety monitoring achieved consistently high safety
rates across decoding methods (See Table 8) despite poor test accuracies and severe miscalibration.
Intervention rates scaled with decoder accuracy, and higher intervention rates were seen in decoders
with lower accuracy. For example, the RealIntent decoder enabled a high safety rate (97%) through
interpretable features, which faciliated reliable safety checking despite low 27% test accuracy.
Noise robustness. The system demonstrated robust safety preservation under simulated noise
conditions (SNR degradation from 20dB to -5dB). Under clean conditions, it yielded a 36.5% safety
rate at baseline but in noisy conditions showed statistically significant improvement (with t=3.283,
p=0.004, Cohen’s d=1.473, large effect), achieving 98.1% correct interventions. This demonstrates
that the safety monitor correctly increased interventions as the signal quality degraded to maintain
> 93% safety rates–a desired conservative behavior for assistive systems reliant on brain signals.

Discussion
Interpretable primitives and generalizability. The four-action manipulation set (GRASP, RELEASE,
MOVE_TO, ROTATE) offers a natural mapping and effective neural control for robotic execution,
aligning with well-studied low-level primitives in assistive manipulation[29]. GUARDIAN’s primitive
design supports development of safe shared autonomy[12, 19] especially when reasoning under goal
uncertainty or partial intent inference, and enables users to understand how their decoded intent
translates to downstream robot action–a key factor in effective human-robot collaboration[5]. Our
approach aligns with policy-blending and hindsight-optimization methods that mix autonomous or
user-driven control under uncertainty[12, 20]. The modular and compact nature of GUARDIAN
provides practical value to complement existing BCI-controlled assistive robotic systems[17, 23, 34].
Adaptive thresholds for safe EEG-based control. The observed drop in validation to test accuarcies
in neural decoders can be attributed to non-stationarity where “more training data does not help”,
subject drift and noise, each of which remain a challenge for BCI systems[22, 31]. Even models that
exhibit high reliability during development testing fail to maintain calibration or generalization at
deployment[15, 26]. In closed-loop systems, the cost of a misclassified or unsafe action is amplified;
errors immediately perturb the user’s intent decoding, potentially inducing panic, mistrust, or unstable
feedback loops[5, 12, 20]. When such errors accumulate over time, the inaccuracies compound and
propagate, ultimately making long-horizon or continuous robotic control tasks infeasible[33].
A runtime dual-invariant framework protects against these risks through a combination of calibration-
independent physiological invariants and logical invariants that preserve plan consistency regardless
of confidence. Our threshold evaluation demonstrates that single-threshold systems require safety
thresholds between 0.8–0.9 to achieve 68–87% intervention rates, while our multi-level adaptive
system maintains 94–97% safety by adjusting intervention rates based on decoder reliability[15, 26].
Real-world applicability. GUARDIAN extends to human-robot collaborative and assistive do-
mains, ranging from neuroprosthetic control, motor-rehabilitation robotics, shared autonomy and
co-adaption. Through structured audit logs and intervention traces, GUARDIAN provides a certifiable
runtime safety guard that operates under established regulatory frameworks [1, 4, 11], and facilitates
transparent and verifiable operation within healthcare and high-assurance robot autonomy contexts.

Conclusion
Limitations and future work. While our system delivers real-time safety verification and decoder-
agnostic performance, it still faces operational constraints: future experiments should explore user
adaptation, cognitive load and trust development over time[5, 20, 29]. Requiring high interven-
tion rates to achieve decoder reliability may create issues with task fluency, user satisfaction or
autonomy[12, 20]. In practice, thresholds may be tailored to the fatigue profiles or cognitive load
of the subject[22, 31]. New sensing technologies could be used to integrate richer physiological
invariants to test for signal quality [9]. The current framework operates with fixed pre-trained de-
coders, but future studies should test real-time verification alongside decoder and subject calibration
efforts[15, 26, 29].
Neural decoders can produce unpredictable behavior and incorrect results, so accuracy alone cannot be
a sufficient measure of trustworthy deployment in neurally-operated robot interfaces[15, 26]. Reliable

deployment of BCI and human-robot systems will require architectures that are legible to users or
can reason about their own uncertainty to maintain verifiable safety[7]. GUARDIAN provides a step
toward this vision and opens up new avenues for practical runtime solutions, such as performing sub-
millisecond safety checks to reduce user burden, while maintaining compatibility with, and improving
the explainability of, existing BCI-controlled systems through its decoder-agnostic design[6, 17].

Formal Safety Definitions
We denote by aintended,t ∈H the ground-truth (user-intended) action at trial t, by aexecuted,t ∈H ∪{HALT} the
action actually executed after monitoring, by yt ∈H the true class label, by ˆyt ∈H the decoder’s predicted
class (prior to monitoring), and by It ∈{0, 1} an indicator that the monitor intervened (1) or not (0).

Safety violation.
A safety violation occurs when the robot executes an active manipulation action that wasn’t
intended:
Vt =









1, if aexecuted,t ̸= aintended,t
∧aexecuted,t ∈{GRASP, RELEASE,
MOVE_TO, ROTATE},
0, otherwise.
(5)
All four actions are considered safety-critical, because unintended execution could cause harm. For example,
this could indicate incorrect grasping, premature releasing, unintended movement, or improper rotation.
Correct intervention.
An intervention is correct when:
Ct =

Intervention Analysis
When interventions were analyzed across decoders, the leading cause of interventions across all systems was
identified to be low confidence, where entropy H(pt) exceeded the threshold τH. In particular, this happened in
38.2% (EEGNet), 45.6% (Riemann), 48.3% (LigntCNN), and 49.1% (RealIntent) of all interventions. High
artifacts, where At > τA, comprised 8.7 −11.3% of interventions across decoders. High oscillation, where
Ωt > τΩ, comprised 3.4 −6.2% of interventions across decoders. The least common cause of intervention was
logical violations. Overall, total intervention rates were at 52.3% for EEGNet, 68.1% for Riemannian, 70.4%
for Lignt CNN, and 71.2% for Real Intent decoders.

Failure Mode Analysis
Safety monitoring failed in 5.8% of cases. Out of these cases, the most common failure type was high-confidence
misclassification (42%). Rapid oscillations were undetected in 28% of failure cases analyzed. Sometimes EMG
signals were incorrectly interpreted as MI, and such misidentification of artifacts as valid signal represented 18%
of failure cases. The least common failure mode was the logical check being bypassed (12%), which happened
when invalid plans were not correctly caught by the system.
