Abstract
While generative video models have achieved remarkable fi-
delity and consistency, applying these capabilities to video
editing remains a complex challenge. Recent research has
extensively explored motion controllability as a means to
enhance text-to-video generation or image animation; how-
ever, we identify precise motion control as a promising, yet
under-explored, paradigm for editing existing videos. In
this work, we propose modifying video motion by directly
editing sparse trajectories extracted from the input. We term
the deviation between input and output trajectories a ‘mo-
tion edit’ and demonstrate that this representation, when
coupled with a generative backbone, enables many power-
ful video editing capabilities. To achieve this, we introduce
a novel pipeline for generating ‘motion counterfactuals’ —
video pairs that share identical content but distinct motion
— and fine-tune a motion-conditioned video diffusion ar-
chitecture on this dataset. Our approach allows for edits
that start at any timestamp and propagate naturally. In a 4-
way head-to-head user study, our model achieves over 65%
preference against prior work. Please see our project page:

1. Introduction
Consider filming a climactic race between two dogs: your
Corgi and a friend’s Bichon. The original video sees the Bi-
chon take the win. After countless recent advances in gener-
ative models, does the technology exist to modify this video
such that your Corgi is victorious? We propose a method for
generalized motion editing in existing user-provided videos
that successfully tackles this unsolved problem.
Historically, tackling this problem in the VFX indus-
try has been notably hard. A reshoot for scenes that need
substantial changes is usually the necessary option. VFX
pipelines can use tricks like retiming and plate stitching,
isolated retimes with rotoscoping, or even full-dog CGI re-
placements. These typically require a high level of skill and
large amounts of human hours.
Modern generative models, with their impressive priors,
show promise in tackling traditional VFX tasks. In this sub-
field, current methods for motion editing fall into different
categories, each exhibiting significant constraints. Image-
to-video (I2V) based approaches like Re-Video [24] and
Go-with-the-Flow [3] can only generate new video with
specified motion conditioned on a single image. Using these
on the first frame of a video can give the illusion of video
motion control, but have significant drawbacks. For exam-
ple, content generated in regions that do not appear in that
initial frame will be entirely hallucinated, whereas for true
video motion editing these regions are known and should
remain identical. Re-Video attempts to address this prob-
lem by inpainting information from the original video into
the edited video, a technique which fundamentally breaks
down when the video includes camera movement. Human-
specific methods like MotionFollower and MotionEditor
can edit motion but are limited to full-body human move-
ments and cannot handle general objects or scenes. Like-
wise there are also works that allow editing camera trajec-
tories in videos such as ReCapture [44] and ReCamMas-
ter [1]. These are not able to edit subject motion.
In this work we introduce motion edits, a new approach
for editing videos by controlling the change in motion from
the original to the edited video using video diffusion mod-
els.
While there has been a large amount of successful
recent work on appearance-based video editing (i.e. trans-
forming visual style while preserving motion structure),
motion editing presents a fundamentally different chal-
lenge. When editing how objects move within a scene (e.g.
making a person walk in a different direction), the struc-
tural correspondence between input and output videos is
broken. This makes the problem harder than appearance-
based video editing and renders standard video editing tech-
niques like DDIM inversion ineffective.
Our method addresses this problem, and the limitations
of prior work, by acting on the complete video and its mo-
tion representation. Users provide an input video along with
some sparse tracking points on objects they wish to control;
these objects are then automatically tracked throughout the

Figure 1. Motion Edits Framework: Users provide an input video along with source motion tracks (colored dots connected by lines, ex-
tracted from the input) and target motion tracks (user-specified desired motion). Lines indicate point trajectories while dot presence/absence
indicates visibility. Our diffusion model generates an output video matching the target motion. Applications: Our method can edit videos
in a true sense, where content is preserved but motion is changed.
video. Users can then choose to either anchor these points
(to preserve original motion) or modify them (to edit the tra-
jectory). For example, in a video of a person walking into a
crowd, the system tracks both entities; the user can specify
a new direction for the person by altering their tracks while
strictly preserving the crowd’s original motion. In a more
complex edit, the user can change the camera by editing all
the points.
Our approach enables diverse video editing capabilities
(Fig. 1): object motion editing, camera motion editing, con-
trol over the timing of content, and successive edits. The
motion edits are naturally introduced into the output video
and the video model handles plausibility correctly - e.g.
when dragging a person’s tracking point through an im-
age the model will make the person traverse the image
by walking.
Our approach requires no manual masking
and can handle any type of object, while also maintaining
scene consistency even when both object motion and cam-
era movement are edited simultaneously. And in contrast
to prior methods, our approach also allows the ability to
change when an object appears in the frame. Finally, our
model generalizes to vastly different scenes and objects and
achieves state-of-the-art performance in quantitative com-
parisons and human evaluations.
In summary, we propose the following contributions:
• We identify motion as a powerful control signal for video
editing and propose directly editing sparse trajectories ex-
tracted from the input video to change the motion of the
output video. We define the change between the input and
target trajectories as a “motion edit” and show that motion
edits, coupled with a powerful generative video model,
can address several challenging video editing tasks.
• We present a methodology to train a video diffusion
model to generate high quality “motion counterfactual”
video pairs which have the scene appearance but different
motion. As part of this, we also identify sources of data
that work well in this training.
• We propose a new model architecture with careful condi-
tioning on both user-specified video and motion trajecto-
ries that generates a motion-edited output.

2. Related Works
Diffusion models have fundamentally reshaped media gen-
eration, evolving from foundational image synthesis frame-
works [13, 31] to complex video dynamics [2, 14, 15, 33].
Recent text-conditioned video models [36, 42, 49] have fur-
ther advanced the field by adopting transformer-based ar-
chitectures [27] for scalable denoising.
2.1. Conditional Video Generation
Conditional video diffusion extends base text-to-video ar-
chitectures by incorporating auxiliary control signals. In-
spired by the spatial conditioning of ControlNet [46], recent
works have adapted similar mechanisms to the temporal do-
main [12, 16, 32], enabling guidance through depth maps,
motion vectors, and camera parameters.
Concurrently,
video-to-video (V2V) editing methods focus on propagat-
ing edits across frames while preserving the features of
the source video [4, 11, 18, 25, 29, 38, 40]. Many such
approaches leverage DDIM inversion to facilitate appear-
ance modifications [5, 22, 26]. However, these methods
are fundamentally designed for local appearance changes;
they struggle with non-local motion edits where the struc-
tural correspondence between frames is disrupted. When
motion patterns are altered, the temporal alignment assump-
tions underlying these inversion-based approaches are vio-
lated.
2.2. Motion-Guided Video Generation
Motion control has emerged as a critical research direc-
tion, broadly categorized into trajectory-based and optical-
flow-based methods. Trajectory-based approaches condi-
tion generation on point trajectories [8, 9, 21, 23, 30, 35,
39, 41, 43, 47, 48], granting precise control over object
paths, camera movement, and complex interactions. Con-
versely, optical flow-based methods [19, 20] utilize dense
correspondence priors derived from optical flow estimators
and point trackers [6, 7, 17, 34] to achieve fine-grained mo-
tion transfer.
Despite their impressive capabilities, these methods op-
erate primarily as generators rather than editors. Instead
of modifying an input video directly, they extract attributes
(e.g., optical flow) to condition the synthesis of an entirely
new video. Recent trajectory-based methods [3, 10, 37] at-
tempt to bridge this by conditioning on single images and
motion trajectories. However, while powerful for content
creation, they fail to preserve the unrevealed visual context
of existing videos when motion is modified. First-frame
preserving methods like ReVideo [24] attempt to address
this via inpainting but degrade when camera motion reveals
content absent from the initial frame.
Our method addresses these limitations to enable true
video-to-video motion editing. Specifically, we allow for
flexible modification of object and camera trajectories while
rigorously preserving the remaining video content. This ap-
proach generalizes effectively to arbitrary objects, diverse
camera motions, and complex multi-element scenes.
3. Our Approach
In this section, we present a video-to-video motion editing
framework that integrates a motion description mechanism
with a video diffusion model. Our approach enables four
core capabilities: object motion (altering movement while
preserving static backgrounds, e.g., moving a dog but not
the scene); camera control (simultaneously manipulating
object and camera perspective, e.g., panning while an ob-
ject moves); temporal control (adjusting trajectory timing,
e.g., delaying an action to the 5th second); and arbitrary
frame specification (applying edits across any frame span).
We demonstrate that explicitly defining ‘motion edits’,
which explicitly describe the desired change in motion, en-
ables our system to robustly support these tasks. We first
outline these capabilities in detail, followed by our key tech-
nical contributions: the motion counterfactual video gener-
ation method and our specialized video-to-video architec-
ture.
3.1. Editing Video through Motion Edits
Moving Objects By identifying an object’s trajectory and
editing it, we can change the motion of the object as the
video progresses. As shown in Figure 1 and 2, this can have
high level effects such as changing the ultimate outcome of
a scenario and is a flexible tool for many applications, such
as re-timing subjects, improve video aesthetics by moving
occluders, or recomposing a video and its parts in motion.
Camera Control With our motion editing scheme we can
control camera pose and motion in the video relative to the
scene. We estimate a dynamic pointmap [45], reproject it
into each frame using user-specified camera extrinsics and
intrinsics, and then solve for deviations in the pointwise tra-
jectories. This allows us to dynamically change the position
and focal length of the camera in any frame while also pre-
serving the video content. We show this in the Swan exam-
ple in Figure 1 where the Swan is swimming and the ripples
in the water are preserved despite changes in the camera po-
sition and in 2 where each frame has a different zoom level
with same scene content.
Time Control Our method allows users to control trajecto-
ries of specific elements in a video independent of the global
timeline. This enables delaying or accelerating an object’s
trajectory, such as making a subject appear on second 5 in-
stead of second 2, while preserving the background’s origi-
nal motion. As shown in Figure 2, we can delay the appear-
ance of a duck until later frames, effectively decoupling the

video, the first frame is zoomed out, middle frame is identical, the last frame is zoomed in. Duck Zoom. The edited video exhibits different
content for a given frame (time) than the original, e.g. in the edited video, the duck is not visible in the first frame whereas it is visible in
the original.
subject’s timeline from that of the scene.
Arbitrary Frame Specification Unlike image-to-video ap-
proaches that rely on the first frame for content genera-
tion [3, 10, 24], our framework supports editing objects that
appear at any point in the video. Relying on the initial frame
severely restricts possible edits and fails to account for el-
ements that emerge later. Additionally, the motion of the
rest of the video is entirely hallucinated whereas ours can
conserve it in part or entirely. By conditioning on the full
video, we enable precise control over mid-stream objects,
such as the stop sign in Figure 3.
Figure 3. Controlling Content on Any Frame. By conditioning
on the full video, we can move and preserve content appearing on
any frame. Methods like ATI rely on the first frame, failing to
control objects, like the sign, that emerge mid-sequence.
3.2. Motion Counterfactual Video Generation
Our approach requires training data consisting of video
pairs with identical visual content but different motion pat-
terns. We generate these motion counterfactual videos Vcf
and corresponding target videos Vtarget from raw videos us-
ing a systematic process that ensures trackable point corre-
spondences between video pairs (Figure 4).
Given a source video Vfull of length Ffull frames, we gen-
erate video pairs as follows. First, we extract the target
video Vtarget by selecting a contiguous frame chunk of length
F with random starting frame fstart ∼Uniform(0, Ffull−F).
We keep real video as targets to ensure the model trains to-
ward realistic motion and appearance.
For the counterfactual video Vcf, we randomly select start
and end frame indices f cf
start, f cf
end ∼Uniform(0, Ffull−1) and
choose one of two generation strategies:
Frame Interpolation: We use a video diffusion model

Figure 4. Counterfactual data generation process. In order to
generate a real / counterfactual video pair and its corresponding
trajectories, we take a full real video, extract a video clip, then
create a counterfactual video. The counterfactual has new motion
from the video generator, as well as temporal and spatial augmen-
tations. In order to ensure we have two corresponding set of tracks,
we specifically use the first and last frames, which directly match
the original video, to anchor the tracks for the counterfactual.
conditioned on frames f cf
start and f cf
end to generate a F-
frame video. This adds new content via LLM-generated
prompts—e.g., instructing a walking person to “twirl” (Fig-
ure 4). This provides more data than first-frame-only meth-
ods, allowing the model to use more of the input video.
Temporal Resampling:
We extract F frames evenly
spaced between f cf
start and f cf
end from Vfull. This creates nat-
ural speed variations, temporal shifts, and sometimes re-
versed motion when f cf
start > f cf
end.
Next, we establish point correspondences between the
video pair.
We initialize N ∼Uniform(1, 64) tracking
points with coordinates (ti, xi, yi) where xi and yi sampled
uniformly from frame dimensions Wrgb, Hrgb respectively.

Figure 5. Our motion-conditioned video diffusion architecture. We extend a T2V DiT model with a control branch that processes
three additional video conditioning channels: the counterfactual video, counterfactual motion tracks, and target motion tracks. The control
branch duplicates the first 18 transformer blocks and integrates with the main branch through zero-initialized MLPs, similar to ControlNet.
• Temporal resampling: Frame indices are sampled from
frames present in both Vtarget and Vcf
• Frame interpolation: Frame indices are restricted to
{f cf
start, f cf
end} to ensure correspondence
We use TAPNext [50], a bidirectional point tracker, on
Vfull with these initial points to obtain target tracks Ttarget.
For counterfactual tracks Tcf: in temporal resampling cases,
we use the same tracker output; for interpolation cases, we
first replace the corresponding frames in Vfull with the inter-
polated Vcf frames before running TAPNext [50].
Finally, we apply geometric augmentations to the coun-
terfactual videos including random sliding crops, rotations,
and scale changes, with the same transformations applied
to the corresponding tracking points to maintain corre-
spondence.
These artificial moving crops approximate
multi-view videos and ensure perfect temporal synchroniza-
tion—giving the model a bias toward synchronizing appear-
ance when otherwise unspecified.
Trajectory Representation
A key part of our method
is our representation of motion throughout videos.
Our
model is conditioned on three videos: the counterfactual
video Vcf, the rendered counterfactual motion tracks Bcf,
and the rendered target motion tracks Btarget, each of dimen-
sion RF ×3×Hrgb×Wrgb. Additionally, like our base model,
text prompts provide semantic conditioning, which we will
leave out of equations in this section for brevity.
We rasterize the tracking information as colored Gaus-
sian blobs on black backgrounds to create motion condition-
ing channels. For each training sample, we randomly select
N distinct random colors. Each tracking point is rendered
as a Gaussian blob with standard deviation of 10 pixels in
its assigned color in both the counterfactual tracks video Bcf
and target tracks video Btarget, with blobs only drawn when
the corresponding point is visible (not occluded) as reported
by the point tracker. We also tried representations similar to
[12], but found that both large number of points and the lack
of distinct colors made it a weaker control signal.
The tracks are subject to dropout during training, with
target motion blobs Ttarget experiencing higher dropout rates
than conditioning tracks Tcf to improve robustness and pre-
vent overfitting to specific motion patterns. During infer-
ence, we limit the number of point correspondences to ap-
proximately 20, as the model fails to follow all correspon-
dences when given too many points.
3.3. Model Architecture
We use a pre-trained T2V DiT as our base model [42]. In
order to condition on motion and input videos we incor-
porate a control branch duplicating the first 18 transformer
blocks of the DiT that feeds into the main branch using
zero-initialized MLPs. Conceptually the control branch is
similar to a ControlNet [46] applied to a DiT architecture.
We are inspired by the architecture proposed in Diffusion-
AsShader [12], but our implementation has the key differ-
ence of allowing conditioning on three video tracks and us-
ing a control branch patchifier that handles 48 = 3 × 16
input channels for the three conditioning videos in latent
space.
The control branch tokens are fed through zero-init [46],
channel-wise MLPs and then added to the main branch to-
ken values in their respective transformer blocks. The base
model processes the noisy video being denoised along with
text conditioning, while our control branch handles the three
additional video conditioning channels Vcf, Bcf, Btarget. All
video inputs are encoded using a 3D Causal VAE [42],
which compresses RGB videos of shape F ×3×Hrgb×Wrgb
to latent representations of shape Flatent ×Clatent ×Hlatent ×
Wlatent where Clatent = 16, Flatent =
  F −1

, Wlatent =

8 . The main branch is frozen while the
control branch is trained.
During training, the model learns to generate target
videos Vtarget that follow specified motion patterns and sat-
isfy the given correspondences between counterfactual and
target tracks. The training objective is conditioned on the
counterfactual video Vcf, its tracks Tcf, the target tracks
Ttarget, and a text prompt describing the scene. This for-
mulation successfully teaches the model to transfer motion
patterns from the target tracks while maintaining the visual
realism of target video content.
The task we tackle is harder than a typical ControlNet
task where the structure is usually given to the model. For
example an edge-to-image ControlNet has a good idea of
what the structure of the output should be with edges as
input. Surprisingly, our adapter works despite the inputs
(video + motion blobs) lacking spatiotemporal synchro-
nization with the output. We hypothesize that transformer
blocks do non-trivial work to achieve this capability.
4. Results
4.1. Implementation Details
We use CogVideoX-5B [42] as our base text-to-video
model for both the finetuned counterfactual video genera-
tion model and the V2V editing model. Training was con-
ducted on 8 H100 GPUs for one week using standard la-
tent diffusion training with L2 loss. We set F = 49, with
input resolution of 480 × 720 pixels, corresponding to la-
tent dimensions of 60 × 90. We use N varying between 1
and 64 during training and set the control branch depth ap-
propriately. We use a learning rate of 10−4 and a dataset
size of 100, 000 videos, for 15, 000 iterations with an effec-
tive batch size of 32. We use an internal video dataset with
500,000 samples.
We evaluate our motion editing approach through user
studies and quantitative metrics, comparing against state-
of-the-art motion control methods.
4.2. User Study
We conducted a user study comparing our method against
three baselines: ATI [37], a trajectory-guided image-to-
video method based on WAN 2.1 [36]; ReVideo [24]; and
Go-with-the-Flow (GWTF) [3]. We manually created 20
test videos spanning diverse scenarios including object mo-
tion editing, camera motion changes, and complex scenes
with multiple moving elements. 41 participants compared
all four methods using the interface shown in the Supple-
mentals, selecting the best video for each of three questions
per test case:
• Q1: “Which video better preserves the input video’s con-
tent?”
• Q2: “Which video better reflects the desired motion?”
• Q3: “Which video is overall a better edit of the input
video?”

Table 1 show that users consistently ranked our method
highest across all questions, with win rates around 70%
compared to 25% for ATI and less than 5% for ReVideo
and GWTF, demonstrating superior content preservation
and motion control.
4.3. Quantitative Evaluation
We developed a quantitative evaluation protocol using pho-
tometric reconstruction error to assess motion editing qual-
ity.
4.3.1. Dataset Construction
We curated a dataset of Ntest = 100 test videos using the
following protocol. Given a source video Vtest of length
Ffull frames, we split it temporally at the midpoint to obtain
V0 = Vtest [1 : Ffull/2] and V1 = Vtest [Ffull/2 : Ffull]. We
then create the counterfactual input by temporally reversing
V1 to get V ′
1, ensuring temporal continuity between V0 and
V ′
1 (i.e., the last frame of V0 matches the first frame of V ′
1).
We selected random internet videos not seen during
training where significant content appears in middle frames
but is not visible in the first frame. To quantify this, we
initialize Npoints = 25 tracking points at the temporal mid-
point of each video and track them bidirectionally using
TAPNext [50]. We retain only videos where a substantial
number of points become occluded when tracked to both
the first and last frames.
4.3.2. Evaluation Protocol
For each test case, we use V0 as input and V1 as the target
video. We provide both our method and ATI with identical
motion trajectories extracted from V1 and measure recon-
struction quality using frame-wise L2 loss:
L2 = 1

where F is the number of frames, Ipred

Our method achieves substantially lower reconstruction
error (Table 2), confirming that our full-video approach bet-
ter preserves content compared to first-frame generation

ible in initial frames.
4.4. Qualitative Comparisons
Iterative Edits. One of the strengths of our technique is
that it can be applied iteratively - taking the output of one
run and using it as input for a successive video edit. This al-
lows users to chain multiple simple, intuitive edits together
in order to achieve a very complicated edit. This iterative
editing also provides more immediate feedback to the user
making the process more transparent and easier to control.
In Fig. 6, we show that a complex edit (an object motion
and a camera change) can be decomposed into its core parts
and applied one by one. While this example demonstrates
some degree of subject drift, this can be attributed in part to
the quality of the base video model. We believe that future
versions of our method will be able to be applied infinitely.
Baseline comparisons.
Figure 7 compares our method
against several baselines in multiple video editing scenarios,
each of which demonstrate the capabilities of our motion
edits. We primarily compare against ATI [37], a trajectory-
guided image-to-video method based on WAN 2.1 [36],
our strongest baseline despite using a more powerful base
model than our CogVideoX base. Subfigure 4 additionally
shows ReVideo [24] and Go-with-the-Flow [3], which rated
poorly in user evaluation—ReVideo lacks text conditioning
and Go-with-the-Flow was not designed for point control.
Edit #1: Complex Edits on the Boat Scene. This edit
moves the boat left and shifts the camera so that mountains
from the original’s last frame appear in the edit’s first. This
requires specifying a substantial temporal trajectory change
and holistic knowledge of the scene content. Ours is the
only method that realistically moves the boat while cor-
rectly adjusting the camera to reveal the mountains at the
beginning of the video.
Edit #2: Reposing a Cheerleader. This edit raises the
cheerleader’s arms. The challenge involves preserving the
red pom-pom, which is absent from the first frame. Ours
successfully modifies the motion while retaining this con-
tent. In contrast, ATI and ReVideo rely solely on the first
frame, leading to unnatural movements and a failure to pre-
serve the pom-pom.
Edit #3: Move The Bicyclist. This edit controls a cyclist
visible only in the final frame of the original video. Ours
correctly propagates the cyclist and tracking dots (cyan, ma-
genta, white) throughout. ATI, lacking full temporal con-
text, misplaces the cyclist and synthesizes wrong buildings
(red circles).
Edit #4: Dog Race.
Differential timing breaks single-
frame-based methods.
We decelerate the Corgi (green
dot) to reverse the race outcome while keeping the Bichon
steady. This requires independent temporal control; ATI
fails to decouple the motions, incorrectly copying the Bi-
chon and transforming a light pole into a tree.
Edit #5: Moving Static Balloons. We add upward motion
to stationary balloons. The white balloon (white dot), which
appears mid-video, challenges partial information methods.
While ATI moves visible balloons, it renders the initially
hidden white balloon orange due to missing appearance
data. Our method uses full video context to maintain correct
colors.
Edit #6: Zooming out on the Swan In this DAVIS [28] ex-
ample, we transform a panning shot into a static, zoomed-
out view. The output field of view differs entirely from the
input, yet the swan must remain anchored to specific vegeta-
tion. Lacking full spatial context, ATI synthesizes a second
swan and produces inconsistent motion.
Edit #7: Retiming a taxi. We do a complex isolated re-
timing of taxi and truck movement. This requires complete
temporal understanding; ATI’s single-frame generation can-
not achieve this reversal. Figure 7 compares our method
against ATI (WAN 2.1-based), as well as ReVideo and Go-
with-the-Flow (in Subfigure 4), both of which were rated
poorly due to their design limitations.
Edit #8: Moving an Offscreen Car. As the camera follows
a red car, a motorcyclist enters late. We reposition this ini-
tially invisible rider behind the car while maintaining con-
sistent background architecture. Lacking future frames to
reference the rider and buildings (red circles), ATI synthe-
sizes incorrect content.

Figure 7. Comparison of our method vs. baselines across eight challenging motion editing scenarios. Each row shows a different editing
task with input video, our result, and ATI’s result (with additional baselines shown for subfigure 4). Icon key: Human Pose (modifying
human motion), Move Object (repositioning objects), Move Camera (changing camera motion), Time Control (retiming events), Changed
All Frames (no shared frames between input/output—impossible for image-to-video methods). Colored dots track correspondence points
throughout the video; dot presence/absence indicates object visibility. Red circles highlight key differences where baselines fail.
Discussion. These scenarios highlight I2V limitations: con-
ditioning only on the first frame prevents leveraging in-
formation from the full input. Our V2V formulation en-
ables bidirectional flow, allowing outputs to pull content
from any input frame. This handles offscreen content, cam-
era changes, and reordering—challenges where I2V meth-
ods like ReVideo [24], Go-with-the-Flow [3], and Motion-
Prompting [10] fail.
5. Conclusion
We developed a new video-to-video motion editing algo-
rithm that allows us to edit the motion of objects, subjects
and camera pose in user-provided videos. To the best of our
knowledge it is the first in its class, compared to other work
that control motion in the image-to-video setup. Our algo-
rithm has a comfortable user interface, where a user drags
sparse point trajectories to control objects or camera mo-
tion.

MotionV2V: Editing Motion in a Video
Supplementary Material
6. Human Interaction
Figure 8. Interface for creating motion edits. The red arrow
shows the transformation from source trajectory (line) to target
trajectory (triangle).
Our motion editing interface (Figure 8) provides an in-
tuitive way to specify complex motion changes without re-
quiring any laborious segmentation or rotoscoping. Users
simply click points on the video to initialize points which
are then tracked bidirectinally to create source trajectories.
Then, the user manipulates these trajectories using Bezier
splines to define the desired target motion, with arrows in-
dicating the transformation from source to target.
The red arrow in the figure illustrates a typical edit,
showing the transformation from the source trajectory (line)
to the target trajectory (triangle). The interface allows users
to scrub through video frames and place trajectory points
as needed. Different tracking points are represented by dif-
ferent colors: red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, and
white.
7. User Study
As described in Section 4, we conducted a user study with
41 participants evaluating 20 test videos to compare our
method against state-of-the-art baselines.
Evaluation
Protocol
Participants
used
the
interface
shown in Figure 10 to compare our method against three
baselines:
ATI [37], ReVideo [24], and Go-with-the-
Flow [3].
The interface presents side-by-side compar-
isons of the original input video alongside results from our
method and all baselines, with colored tracking dots visu-
alizing the motion edits so users can clearly see how each
method interprets the desired motion changes. For each test
case, participants were asked three questions:
• Q1: “Which video better preserves the input video’s con-
tent?”
• Q2: “Which video better reflects the desired motion?”
• Q3: “Which video is overall a better edit of the input
video?”

less than 5% for ReVideo and Go-with-the-Flow.

comparisons with visualized motion edits.
8. Quantitative Evaluation Dataset
Our quantitative evaluation dataset construction is fully de-
scribed in Section 4 (Dataset Construction subsection). We
created Ntest = 100 test videos by splitting videos at their
temporal midpoint and reversing one half to create video
pairs with common starting frames (Figure 11). This pro-
tocol ensures that image-to-video baselines, which require
1

first-frame correspondences, receive inputs they can prop-
erly handle since the tracking points match the first frame.
The dataset specifically includes videos where significant
content appears in middle frames but not in the first frame,
quantified by tracking Npoints = 25 points bidirectionally
from the midpoint.
Figure 11. Test Data Generation. A video is separated at the
middle, and then one half is reversed. This results in two videos
with a common starting frame.
9. Baseline Implementation Details
All baseline methods are image-to-video (I2V) algorithms
with motion control, fundamentally different from our
video-to-video (V2V) approach:
ATI [37]
ATI is based on Wan2.1.
It is a point-based
image-to-video algorithm with controllable motion. For our
baseline, we take the target tracks and apply it to the first
frame of our counterfactual videos, using the target prompts
for text guidance. We use the default number of diffusion
steps and CFG as provided by their public code repository.
ReVideo [24]
ReVideo is based on Stable Video Diffu-
sion. It takes no prompt as an input. It is an image-to-video
point-based motion-controllable algorithm, with the ability
to specify editable regions. Since we are avoiding manual
labor such as rotoscoping we designate the entire video as
an editable region.
Go-with-the-Flow [3]
Go-with-the-Flow is not a point-
based motion control algorithm, but is instead an image-
to-video motion-controllable algorithm driven by warped
noise, which often comes from optical flow. To make this
baseline work, we run the raterized target tracks through
RAFT to get optical flows, and from that create warped
noise that is used to generate the output videos. We use
a more recent Wan2.2-based version of Go-with-the-Flow
to test with, as it is a tougher baseline than their original
CogVideoX-5B model.
The fundamental limitation of all these baselines is their
I2V formulation: they can only access information from the
first frame, preventing them from handling content that ap-
pears later in the video, camera viewpoint changes, or com-
plex temporal reordering. Our V2V approach, in contrast,
can leverage information from any frame of the input video.
10. Ablations
Ours Without Jitter
(Another
basketball 
appears)
Ours With Jitter
Input Video
Figure 12. The effects of trajectory jitter on motion editing.
Top: without jitter, a second basketball appears. Bottom: with 1-2
pixel jitter, the edit follows correctly.
We discovered an interesting phenomenon during in-
ference: when tracking points are pixel-perfectly aligned
with the input video trajectories across multiple frames, the
model exhibits a strong bias toward reproducing the original
video’s semantics rather than following the edited motion.
Figure 12 illustrates this effect. In the top row (with-
out jitter), when tracking points are pixel-perfectly aligned
with the input video, the model exhibits a bias toward repro-
ducing the original video’s semantics. Although the basket-
ball successfully goes through the hoop following the edited
trajectory, a second basketball mysteriously appears behind
the hoop to match the original video where the basketball
passes in front. This occurs because the pixel-perfect align-
ment of other tracking points signals to the model that it
should preserve the content of the entire input video, which
is often the only case where the points are aligned that per-
fectly during training. In the bottom row (with jitter), this
identity-copying behavior is eliminated and the edit follows
the intended motion correctly.
To address this, we introduce a simple but effective
inference-time technique:
“Jitter”.
We add small ran-
dom noise ϵ ∼U(−2, 2) pixels to the (x, y) positions of
all tracking points at each frame. Importantly, this is an
inference-time modification only—the model is not trained
with this jitter. This minimal perturbation (1-2 pixels) is im-
perceptible in the rendered tracks but sufficient to break the
model’s tendency to copy the input video’s identity, allow-
ing it to follow the edited trajectories more faithfully.

11. Future Work
In future work, we consider creating large-scale synthetic
datasets with precise motion counterfactuals made with 3d
software. While our current approach leverages real videos
paired with diffusion-generated conuterfactuals, synthetic
3d data would provide perfect ground truth motion-edit
pairs, enabling exact control over individual object trajec-
tories, physical interactions, and the resulting lighting and
shading changes. This would improve the precision of our
training dataset, possibly allowing even less points to be
used for control.
