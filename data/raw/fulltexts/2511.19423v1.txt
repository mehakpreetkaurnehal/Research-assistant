ABSTRACT
We present Genie-CAT, a tool-augmented large-language-model (LLM) system designed to accelerate
scientific hypothesis generation in protein design. Using metalloproteins (e.g., ferredoxins) as a
case study, Genie-CAT integrates four capabilities—literature-grounded reasoning through retrieval-
augmented generation (RAG), structural parsing of Protein Data Bank files, electrostatic potential
calculations, and machine-learning prediction of redox properties—into a unified agentic workflow.
By coupling natural-language reasoning with data-driven and physics-based computation, the system
generates mechanistically interpretable, testable hypotheses linking sequence, structure, and function.
In proof-of-concept demonstrations, Genie-CAT autonomously identifies residue-level modifications
near [Fe–S] clusters that affect redox tuning, reproducing expert-derived hypotheses in a fraction
of the time. The framework highlights how AI agents combining language models with domain-
specific tools can bridge symbolic reasoning and numerical simulation, transforming LLMs from
conversational assistants into partners for computational discovery.

Introduction
The design of proteins with tailored properties is a central
challenge in computational biology, which requires inte-
gration of biochemistry, structural biology, and machine
learning to generate mechanistically grounded hypothe-
ses. Although the emergence of protein language models
(PLMs) and diffusion-based design frameworks for struc-
tural predictions has revolutionized the field [1, 2]. These
statistical approaches remain limited in inferring structure-
function relationships and their ability to design protein se-
quences that achieve specific biochemical functions [3, 4].
Contemporary design pipelines increasingly blend autore-
gressive sequence modeling, score-based diffusion, and
multimodal priors with evolutionary or physics-informed
constraints [3, 5, 6], yet achieving precision in functional
design typically requires expert-guided interpretation of lit-
erature and structural data to identify changes in the amino
acid sequence (mutations) that enhance activity, stability,
or binding specificity.

Proteins that rely on metal-based redox cofactors pose a
unique computational challenge because these cofactors
act as nanoscale electrical components enabling controlled
electron transfer in metabolism (Liu et al. 2014). Their
behavior is governed by redox potential, which determines
how readily a cofactor donates or accepts electrons. For
iron–sulfur clusters—especially the widespread [4Fe–4S]
units present across all domains of life—small changes
to the surrounding protein environment can substantially
shift redox potential and thereby alter catalytic activity
(Ding, Nakai, and Gong 2022; Ferruz et al. 2023). These
shifts arise from subtle electrostatic interactions that cur-
rent statistical protein models cannot capture reliably, mak-
ing explicit electrostatic and redox modeling essential for
mechanistic protein design.
Recent agentic frameworks have begun to bridge this gap
by combining machine learning with tool use and physics-
based computation to expand the design space and improve
reliability [7, 8]. The AI Scientist family demonstrates how
LLMs can generate ideas, write and run code, and iterate to
produce complete manuscripts in computational domains
[9, 10], while translational efforts are integrating LLMs

with laboratory automation and biofoundries to close the
loop between design and wet-lab testing [11]. However,
these systems lack the domain-specific integration of lit-
erature, structural analysis, and physics-based modeling
needed for protein design.
To address these limitations, we present Genie-CAT: an
LLM-guided agentic system that integrates the interpretive
power of large language models with quantitative physical
modeling and domain-specific computation to generate
hypotheses in protein design. Using proteins with iron–
sulfur clusters as a case study, the system combines four
core capabilities into a unified architecture:
1. Literature-guided reasoning: A RAG capability
for question answering and hypothesis generation,
built by ingesting a publication corpus of one
class of metalloproteins (hydrogenases).
2. Structural analysis: Parsing of protein struc-
tures from Protein Data Bank (PDB)[12] to ex-
tract residue-level properties, such as polarity and
active-site environments.
3. Electrostatic potential calculations: Physics-
based computation of electrostatic landscapes to
probe charge distributions relevant to catalysis.
4. Redox potential modeling: Machine learning
models trained to predict the impact of residue
configurations on the redox properties of [Fe-S]
clusters and related cofactors.
Together, these components form a modular and extensi-
ble framework that can ground LLM-driven reasoning in
biochemical, structural, and energetic evidence, producing
interpretable and actionable hypotheses for downstream
experimental validation.

Related Work
Research relevant to our system sits at the intersection of
machine learning for protein design, physics-based mod-
eling of enzyme electrostatics and redox chemistry, and
agentic large-language model systems for scientific discov-
ery.
2.1
Protein language models and machine learning
for protein design
The past decade has witnessed a fundamental transforma-
tion in computational protein science, driven by modern
deep learning approaches that reframe protein modeling
as a learnable mapping between sequence and structure
[13, 14]. In recent work, ProteinMPNN revolutionized
structure-conditional sequence generation by learning to
predict amino acid sequences that fold into specified back-
bone geometries [1]. Building on this foundation, RFdif-
fusion then extended generative capabilities to structure
generation itself, enabling de novo design of protein folds
through denoising diffusion processes [2]. State-of-the-art
systems now blend backbone-conditional design, diffu-
sion methods, and multimodal priors with evolutionary or
physics-informed constraints [3, 5, 6].
However, these data-driven pipelines face fundamental lim-
itations when designing for specific biochemical functions.
The core challenge lies in interpretability and mechanistic
control [1, 4]. This limitation has motivated the develop-
ment of hybrid approaches that combine the pattern recog-
nition capabilities of language models with physics-based
modeling and domain-specific reasoning [7]. However,
for metalloenzymes, where the catalytic function depends
on precise cofactor coordination, electrostatic fields, and
redox chemistry, purely statistical approaches struggle to
generate mechanistically informed design hypotheses.
2.2
Physics-based modeling of enzyme electrostatics
and redox chemistry
Electrostatic interactions play a fundamental role in en-
zyme catalysis, particularly for metalloenzymes, where
precise charge distributions around cofactors determine cat-
alytic efficiency and selectivity. Long-range electrostatic
fields shape the potential energy landscape surrounding
redox-active centers, modulating electron transfer driving
force and directionality [15–17]. The anisotropic electro-
static potential around [Fe-S] clusters reflects the organi-
zation of polar and charged residues that fine-tune redox
potentials and mediate proton-coupled electron transfer
[18–20].
However, above approaches are continuum models which
neglect local polarization and electronic coupling effects.
This has driven the development of hybrid QM/MM tech-
niques that treat metal clusters quantum mechanically
while embedding the surrounding protein environment
classically [21]. Such approaches have successfully clari-
fied how hydrogen-bonding networks around iron-sulfur
clusters influence reduction potentials, revealing linear re-
lationships between local electric fields and experimental
redox potentials.
2.3
Retrieval-augmented methods and Agentic LLMs
The integration of large language models with external
knowledge sources and computational tools has emerged
as a promising approach for scientific applications re-
quiring both reasoning and domain expertise. Retrieval-
Augmented Generation (RAG) demonstrated how ground-
ing LLM outputs in external corpora can reduce hallucina-
tion and enable knowledge-intensive question answering
[22]. Building on this foundation, the ReAct framework
showed how interleaving chain-of-thought reasoning with
tool use improves interpretability and task success in multi-
step problem-solving scenarios [23].
These capabilities have been extended to create increas-
ingly sophisticated agentic systems for scientific discovery.
Recent ambitious frameworks such as The AI Scientist
demonstrate end-to-end automation in which LLMs gener-

ate research ideas, write and execute code, and iterate to
produce complete manuscripts in computational domains
[9, 10], while translational efforts are integrating LLMs
with laboratory automation and biofoundries to close the
loop between design and wet-lab testing [11].
However, existing agentic frameworks face significant lim-
itations when applied to mechanistic protein design chal-
lenges. General-purpose systems such as The AI Scien-
tist lack the domain-specific tools needed for structural
analysis, electrostatic modeling, and redox chemistry cal-
culations. Conversely, domain-focused systems like Au-
toProteinEngine primarily emphasize statistical model or-
chestration rather than integrating physics-based reason-
ing with literature knowledge. Most critically, current
approaches do not systematically combine multi-modal
evidence—literature insights, structural data, electrostatic
calculations, and predictive models—into unified, inter-
pretable hypotheses for experimental validation.
3
Methods
Genie-CAT addresses these limitations by providing a
modular architecture that specifically integrates the four
types of evidence most critical for metalloenzyme design:
literature-grounded reasoning through RAG, structural
analysis of protein environments, physics-based electro-
static modeling, and machine learning prediction of redox
properties. Rather than pursuing full experimental automa-
tion, our approach emphasizes generating mechanistically
interpretable hypotheses that bridge the gap between sta-
tistical learning and physical understanding, positioning
human experts to make informed design decisions based on
multi-modal computational evidence. Figure 1 provides
an overview of the system, with the primary components
discussed in following sections.
3.1
Literature Ingestion and Indexing
Our RAG design is primarily inspired by PaperQA2 [24],
where we augment each retrieved passage with a paper-
level summary (e.g., the abstract or an offline precom-
puted document summary) to provide broader context in
the prompt. Unlike PaperQA2’s chunk-summary–based
reranking, however, our summaries are used solely for con-
textualization at generation time alongside the retrieved
chunk. This pairing of document-level summaries (global
context) with chunk-level evidence (local context) allows
us to rank the find the most relevant publications pertain-
ing to the question while proving local context to answer
the question correctly. Our approach can be viewed as a
multiple-abstraction-level RAG design [25].
To compile our literature corpus, we collected around 1600
relevant publications on hydrogenases and related metal-
loenzymes. The documents were parsed using pdfplumber
library [26]. The text was normalized and segmented
into fixed-length overlapping windows to support context-
aware retrieval. For this study, we adopted 500-character
Table 1: RAG evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge: Results
are reported averaged over 10 independent runs. The sys-
tem was given 99 questions to answer and an independent
LLM was used to rate answer correctness using a scale of
1 (not correct)–5 (completely correct).

segments with 100-character overlap. Each segment is en-
coded with the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 sentence transformer
with 384-dimensional embeddings [27]. The embeddings
are stored in a FAISS index [28] and configured for cosine
similarity.
For evaluation, we follow the RAG Evaluation cookbook
[29]. We synthesize 99 questions from the literature corpus
using a generation and critique pipeline. An LLM gener-
ates candidate question–answer(QA) pairs, and critique
agents score QA pairs on groundedness, relevance, and
standalone clarity on a discrete 1 to 5 scale, discarding
items with scores lower than 3. For answer grading, we
reuse the cookbook’s LLM-as-a-judge prompt and its 1 to
5 correctness rubric. The scores reported in Table 1 are
computed directly from these judge scores. Each question
is answered in two isolated settings: (i) GPT-5-mini with-
out retrieval (no RAG) and (ii) Genie-CAT with retrieval
context with a medium thinking budget. Table 1 reports
aggregated results over 10 runs: Genie-CAT with RAG
achieves a higher mean score (4.38 vs. 4.01) and a 0.30
win rate with 0.55 ties, indicating consistent gains from
retrieval while avoiding overconfident failures.
In addition to answering questions from literature, RAG
component also allows scientists to click on citations to
see the paper summary as well as retrieved sections of
papers that were used to generate the answer. This enable
trust and provides an opportunity for scientists to view
the reasoning process. Figure 2 shows an example of the
user interface, RAG results and the view of the retrieved
context.
3.2
Structural Preprocessing and Residue-Level
Analysis
Genie-CAT provides functionality to parse protein struc-
tures available in Protein Data Bank (PDB) and extracting
residue-level features such as polarity, coordination, and
active-site environments. Protein structures are accepted
from three sources: user uploads, preloaded entries, and
previously downloaded files. If none is found, the structure
is automatically downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data
Bank when a valid identifier is provided. Structures are
parsed with MDAnalysis [30, 31] tool. Iron atoms are iden-
tified and used as reference points to compute distances

Figure 1: Overview of Genie-CAT’s LLM-guided agentic system workflow: The system identifies the different
components in the workflow to be executed based on user query. Inputs (literature, PDB structures) are then processed
through RAG, structural analysis, electrostatic calculations, and/or redox modeling. The evidence from different
analysis is then summarized to the scientist enabling them to generate mechanistic hypotheses
from the centers of mass of the residues. The local en-
vironment is defined by a tunable spherical cutoff Rcut.
Each residue is assigned to physicochemical classes and
recorded with its chain identifier and residue number. The
procedure yields a summary of residue-level measurements
and statistics. Genie-CAT then produces figures (distance
histograms, class distributions, and chain breakdowns) us-
ing Matplotlib integration (Figure 3) allowing scientists
to study and compare-contrast protein structures and the
associated properties.
3.3
Electrostatic Potential Computation and
Visualization
Electrostatic calculations are based on solving the Poisson-
Boltzmann (PB) equation for a discrete charge distribution
that represents the electrostatic field of a protein. We em-
ploy a three-stage workflow: structural preparation, APBS-
based potential-grid computation, and evaluation of poten-
tials on molecular surfaces.
First, the protein structure is prepared for electrostatic
calculations by identifying cofactors and their ligands, as-
signing point charges to each atom, and then evaluating the
electrostatic potential. The point charges are taken from
standard molecular mechanics force fields [32], literature,
in-house databases, or estimated on the fly if they are not
otherwise available. Our in-house database includes pa-
rameters for a variety of iron–sulfur cofactors (e.g., SF4
for cubanes, FES for di-iron motifs, F3S for open cubanes,
etc.). Next, the PB equation is solved using the grid-based
Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) [33]. Finally,
the electrostatic potentials are mapped onto molecular sur-
faces for further analysis and visualization. Visualization
is performed by generating a PyMOL script that renders
either surface-mapped electrostatic potentials or focused
views of iron–sulfur clusters. Importantly, the agent is also
provided with in-house tools for comparing the electro-
static maps of iron–sulfur cofactors across different pro-
teins and for detecting changes due to protein modifica-
tions.
3.4
Redox Potential Model for Reasoning about
Ligand Mutations
The computed electrostatic field of the protein, is then
used as input to predict the impact of residue changes and
mutations on the redox properties of [Fe-S] clusters. We
developed a novel machine learning model that enforces
invariances reflecting the approximately D2d-symmetric
[4Fe-4S] core while accommodating protein-induced dis-
tortions. Concretely, the representation is invariant to
global rotations and to within-cluster permutations (Fe
and S subgroups), which regularizes learning and focuses
the model on physically meaningful descriptors rather than
orientation or atom ordering. This allows us to predict the

effect of structural changes and amino acid substitutions
on the redox potential rather than the absolute positioning
of a ligand relative to Fe–S clusters.
The redox potential model begins by encoding each Fe–S
complex into a feature vector consisting of the positions
of the atoms and the corresponding electric fields on each
atom of the [Fe-S] clusters. From these quantities, we
construct scalar features (e.g., sorted ligand descriptors, ra-
dial distances, pairwise cosines between bond vectors, and
normalized triple products) that are permutation-invariant
across the four atoms of each group; concatenating these
sets yields an invariant encoding ϕg

The redox potential is predicted by a fully connected multi-

layers of widths (256, 128), rectified linear activations,
and a dropout layer with rate 0.1 before the final linear
layer, where θ denotes the network parameters. Before
training, each component of xi and the target potential
Ei is standardized using training-set statistics so that the
network operates on z-scored features while preserving the
analytically enforced invariances. The normalized predic-
tion for complex i is ˆEi = fθ(˜xi) with ˜xi denoting the
standardized feature vector.
Model parameters are optimized with AdamW [34] using a
learning rate of 10−3, decoupled weight decay coefficient
λ = 10−4, and minibatches of size 1024. For a full dataset

Software Architecture
Genie-CAT is implemented as a modular, tool-augmented
language model system within a single containerized run-
time. A Streamlit application provides the user interface
and hosts a LangGraph ReAct agent that invokes typed
tools for literature retrieval, structural analysis of Protein
Data Bank files, and electrostatic potential computation
and visualization in response to user queries (Figure 1).
Modular, Extensible Design. Each capability is imple-
mented as an independent tool, enabling new physics en-
gines or ML models to be integrated without modifying
the core agent. This design supports planned extensions to
high-fidelity simulations—including QM/MM, DFT clus-
ter models, and large-scale MD—by allowing new tools to
register input schemas, submit compute jobs, and return
results through the same interface.
5

Agentic LLM Framework for Mechanistic Enzyme Design
A PREPRINT
ReAct-based reasoning. The agent uses a ReAct (Reason-
ing and Acting) [23] pattern: the LLM iteratively generates
thoughts, invokes tools (RAG retrieval, ESP calculations,
redox prediction, Shell, Python REPL), observes results,
and synthesizes answers grounded in retrieved or computed
evidence. Tool selection and ordering are determined dy-
namically based on the query and intermediate results.
Performance Characteristics. Typical queries require
1–5 LLM calls depending on complexity.
RAG-only
queries and structural parsing queries respond in 1–5
seconds, while ESP computations complete in 120-180
seconds. The average inference time for redox model was
around 20 seconds. Future HPC integration will allow
long-running simulations (QM/MM, extended MD) to run
asynchronously, with the system returning a job ID and
later fetching results into the reasoning chain.

Agentic Multi-Modal Reasoning on
Metalloenzymes: A Ferredoxin as a Test
Case
To test the end-to-end mechanistic (structure-to-function)
reasoning capabilities of Genie-CAT, we use a ferredoxin
containing two [4Fe–4S] clusters from Clostridium
pasteurianum (PDB code 1CLF), which is frequently used
as a model system for redox-active [4Fe–4S] proteins.
This case study illustrates how the agent coordinates
retrieval, structural parsing, electrostatic modeling, and
ML-based redox prediction to construct mechanistically
grounded hypotheses about impact of residue-level
modifications in proteins with minimal user intervention.
Figure 4 illustrates the primary step(s) and the results
generated by Genie-CAT.
Step 1: Structural ingestion and descriptor extraction.
The user query about 1CLF, initiates Genie-CAT to
automatically retrieve the structure from PDB and parse
with MDAnalysis tools. Genie-CAT identified the two
[4Fe–4S] clusters and extracted residue-level descriptors
including polarity, solvent accessibility, and atomic
distances within a 6 Å cutoff around Fe atoms (Figure 4:
top-left). Summary tables and heatmaps highlighted mod-
est but noticeable microenvironment differences(Figure
4: right): one cluster sits in a slightly more hydrophobic
pocket, while the second has a somewhat higher density of
nearby polar or charged residues (e.g., Asn, Asp). These
differences are consistent with known asymmetries in
ferrodoxins.
Step 2: Electrostatic potential computation.
Elec-
trostatic potentials were computed using APBS with
the Amber ff14SB force field [35] and in-house Fe–S
parameters. Surface visualizations showed anisotropic
negative fields around both cubanes, consistent with
established electrostatic profiles of ferredoxins. While
qualitative, these maps provide physically interpretable
signals that contextualize potential redox shifts.
Step 4: Prediction of the redox potential. From the ESP
grid, Genie-CAT derived local electric-field vectors and
scalar descriptors for each cluster. These were combined
with geometric invariants based on pairwise distances
and triple products among cluster atoms, producing
a 57-dimensional feature vector.
The agent passed
this feature vector to the redox-prediction model. The
predicted ordering matched expectations for ferredoxins:
the cluster in the more hydrophobic environment exhibited
a slightly more negative predicted potential (-425 mV),
while the cluster with greater local polarity was shifted
in the positive direction (-370 mV). Magnitudes were
within tens of millivolts of the reported trends for related
Fe–S proteins, providing a reasonable internal consistency
check.
Step 5: Correlation and mechanistic interpretation.
Genie-CAT synthesized these results as sown in Figure 4,
allowing scientists to form new or validate existing hypoth-
esis: linking local polarity to redox modulation. The agent
inferred that the introduction of additional polar residues
near the more hydrophobic cluster may stabilize the oxi-
dized states and increase its potential. These predictions
are consistent with previously reported trends for bacte-
rial ferredoxins in asymmetric cubane environments [36].
In general, these suggestions reproduce qualitative design
principles for Fe–S proteins and illustrate how Genie-CAT
converts structural and electrostatic evidence into action-
able hypotheses for downstream evaluation.
6
Discussion
Genie-CAT demonstrates how an agentic LLM can
move beyond text-only assistance toward mechanistically
grounded hypothesis generation for metalloproteins. By
integrating literature-grounded reasoning (RAG), struc-
tural parsing of PDB files, electrostatic potential calcu-
lations, and a redox predictor into a single workflow, the
system produces proposals that explicitly tie sequence- and
environment-level edits to hypothesized energetic conse-
quences at metal centers. This reduces the gap between
idea generation and quantitative analysis, providing users
with tractable, testable hypotheses rather than open-ended
suggestions.
Genie-CAT’s agent significantly reduces the time and ex-
pertise barriers for novel hypothesis generation. We es-
timate that, for a user to perform the sequence of ESP
and redox calculations manually, it would take days to
weeks depending on expertise. In contrast, Genie-CAT
runs such calculations in less than 3 minutes per protein.
In addition, the expertise and time savings provided by the
RAG component are invaluable, providing reliable scien-
tific grounding by reducing the risk of hallucination. The
ferredoxin case study illustrates these benefits in a realistic
setting.

Agentic LLM Framework for Mechanistic Enzyme Design
A PREPRINT
Figure 4: Example interactive session with Genie-CAT on ferredoxin 1CLF. The user issues three sequential queries:
(Q1) compute electrostatic potentials for 1CLF, (Q2) predict the redox potentials of its two [4Fe–4S] clusters, and (Q3)
generate comparative figures and tables, including a structural plot of the protein. For each query, the agent selects and
orchestrates the appropriate tools (APBS-based electrostatics, symmetry-aware redox predictor, and plotting utilities),
then synthesizes the outputs into natural-language answers and visual artifacts, illustrating end-to-end, multi-modal
reasoning within a single workflow.
Each component of Genie-CAT addresses a distinct fail-
ure mode common in LLM-only workflows. Literature
retrieval grounds claims and mitigates hallucination; struc-
tural parsing turns text prompts into precise residue- and
environment-level contexts; electrostatics provides a phys-
ically interpretable field-level signal; and the redox model
aggregates geometric and electrostatic descriptors to sup-
port ranking and sensitivity analyses. The agent then syn-
thesizes these heterogeneous signals into concise ratio-
nales, making assumptions explicit and highlighting the
evidentiary basis for each recommendation.
There are significant limitations. First, literature-grounded
reasoning depends on corpus coverage and curation; gaps
or biases in the ingestion set can propagate to hypothe-
ses. Second, continuum electrostatics (APBS) provides a
tractable but approximate description near metal centers,
where polarization and quantum effects can be significant.
Third, the redox predictor is trained on finite, domain-
specific data and may not uniformly generalize across
metalloprotein families or unusual coordination motifs;
calibration and uncertainty quantification remain active
areas of work. Finally, analyses are typically performed
on single structures or a small ensemble, and thus may
underrepresent conformational heterogeneity.
Despite these caveats, the agentic pattern is extensible.
Future iterations can broaden the corpus beyond journal
articles to include curated databases and structured reac-
tion/thermodynamic data; incorporate conformational sam-
pling via atomistic molecular dynamics to expose the agent
to ensemble-averaged features; and integrate hybrid quan-
tum mechanical/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) or po-
larizable empirical force-field methods for higher-fidelity
local electrostatics when warranted. Beyond Fe–S systems,
the same workflow can accommodate heme, Fe–CO, and
other inorganic cofactors by extending parameter libraries
and descriptors, while tightening the loop with automation
and wet-lab feedback to refine both retrieval and predictive
components iteratively.

Conclusion
The results presented here highlight the need for dedicated
scientific agents in mechanistic protein design. General-
purpose LLM systems excel in broad reasoning, but lack
access to the structural, electronic, and thermodynamic evi-
dence required to produce reliable biochemical hypotheses.
In contrast, Genie-CAT’s domain-specific tooling enables
the agent to ground its reasoning in quantifiable physical
descriptors, such as electrostatic fields, Fe-S geometry, and
symmetry-aware redox features, thereby reducing hallu-
cination and improving mechanistic interpretability. This
integration is essential in metalloprotein design, where
subtle environment-dependent effects can shift redox ther-

modynamics by a few tens of millivolts and where high-
level textual reasoning alone is insufficient. By combining
retrieval, structure, biochemistry, physics, and machine
learning within a single orchestrated workflow, a dedicated
agent can serve as a scientific assistant that augments ex-
pert intuition, accelerates design iteration, and makes pre-
viously labor-intensive analyses available through natural
language queries.
Genie-CAT links local environment features to predicted
redox shifts at [4Fe–4S] clusters, generating concrete
residue-level proposals suitable for downstream test-
ing. Looking ahead, expanding corpus coverage, adding
ensemble- and QM-aware physics, and integrating uncer-
tainty and experimental feedback will further strengthen
the reliability and impact of agent-guided hypothesis gen-
eration in protein design.
