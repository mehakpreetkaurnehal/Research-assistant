ABSTRACT
Using Bayesian transfer learning, we develop a particle filter approach for tracking a nonlinear dy-
namical model in a dual-tracking system where intensities of measurement noise for both sensors
are asymmetric. The densities for Bayesian transfer learning are approximated with the sum of
weighted particles to improve the tracking performance of the primary sensor, which experiences a
higher noise intensity compared to the source sensor. We present simulation results that validate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to an isolated particle filter and transfer learning
applied to the unscented Kalman filter and the cubature Kalman filter. Furthermore, increasing the
number of particles shows an improvement in the performance of transfer learning applied to the
particle filter with a higher rate compared to the isolated particle filter. However, increasing the
number of particles raises computational time per step. Moreover, the performance gain from incor-
porating Bayesian transfer learning is approximately linearly proportional to the absolute difference
value between the noise intensities of the sensors in the dual-tracking system.

Introduction
Tracking systems have recently received significant attention due to the growing demand for higher accuracy in various
applications such as object tracking, surveillance, navigation, self-driving vehicles, and computer vision. In object
tracking applications, observed data from multiple sensors is often combined using various data fusion techniques to
improve overall tracking accuracy [2–4]. In scenarios of a dual separated tracking system, where two tracking systems
track the same area at the same time, the two tracking systems are typically assumed to experience similar measurement
noise intensity. However, this assumption may not always hold true as each tracking system can encounter various
environmental conditions in practice.
We consider a scenario of dual tracking systems for tracking a single object, where the fields of view of the two
separated tracking systems overlap. One of the dual-tracking systems is referred to as the primary tracking filter, while
the other is the source tracking filter. Each of the tracking systems employs a particle filter to track the common object
along a nonlinear trajectory. We shall assume that the primary tracking filter’s field of view (FOV) encounters higher
noise intensity or clutter in its measurements compared to that of the source tracking filter. Our aim is to improve
the tracking performance of the primary tracking filter by leveraging knowledge from the source tracking filter using
Bayesian transfer learning (BTL).

Incorporating BTL into PF for Dual-Tracking System with Asymmetric Noise Intensities
A PREPRINT
1.1
Motivation
Transfer learning or knowledge transfer, a machine learning technique, has recently been introduced into Bayesian
models involving multiple tracking systems [5]. This approach is referred to as BTL [6–9]. Transfer learning allows
knowledge gained from a source domain to improve the performance of a target domain that has the challenge of
performing its own task accurately. BTL has been adopted to model Gaussian process regression with multiple tasks
to effectively address the interactions between the source and target tasks [10,11]. Furthermore, online object tracking
has been modeled using BTL to allow the transfer of visual priors into the tracking process framework to improve
performance under complex conditions [12].
A real-world scenario for online transfer learning occurs when multiple operators have tracking systems covering
the same area of interest. Such systems often have different configurations, preventing them from processing raw
observations from other operators. In this case, common variables, which are predicted observations, can be widely
adapted worldwide to be transferred between these operators to enhance each other tracking performance. For instance,
ships in a complex maritime environment leverage transferred information for the purpose of enhancing their detection
and tracking performance using the Detection Tracking Network (DTNet) [13]. Furthermore, autonomous vehicles of
different manufacturers can cooperate through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication in order to improve tracking
performance by recursively sharing useful information [14,15].
BTL has been applied to a pair of Kalman filters with asymmetric noise intensities for tracking an object following a
linear motion model [16–20]. The incorporation of BTL with a Bayesian filter, referred to as a Bayesian transfer learn-
ing filter (BTLF), aims to enhance the estimation performance of the primary tracking filter, whose FOV is affected
by severe conditions, by leveraging gained knowledge from the source tracking filter. In the BTLF framework, the
primary tracking filter has no access to any realization of the source tracking system except the observation predictor
of the source tracking filter according to [16]. BTLF has been previously applied in [21] to track a nonlinear motion
model using a local approximation approach, where the posterior density follows the form of the prior density. In this
approach, the predicted observation parameters, i.e., the mean and covariance, obtained from Bayesian filtering using
an unscented Kalman filter, were transferred from the source tracking filter to the primary tracking filter. The BTL
approach is different from measurement vector fusion (MVF) [22] and distributed estimation filtering methods such as
distributed Kalman filtering (DKF) [23–25], in which the source tracking system directly transfers its estimated states
or measurements to the primary tracking system. The drawbacks of MVF and DKF relative to the BTLF approach
are as follows: (i) higher communication overhead in transferring cluttered observation data, (ii) one time-step delay
in the transferred information, and (iii) from a security or privacy perspective, the raw observation data may contain
information that the source may not which to disclose.
1.2
Contribution
To the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous applications of global approaches, whereby no explicit
assumption is made about the form of the posterior density, in the context of BTLF. A popular global approach
for nonlinear filtering is the particle filter (PF) with importance resampling [26, 27]. Our main contribution is to
approximate BTLF via a PF to track a nonlinear dynamical motion model in a dual-tracking system under asymmetric
measurement noise intensities. Our simulation results show that the estimation accuracy performance of the proposed
transfer learning particle filter (TL-PF) scheme, which incorporates BTLF with PF, is significantly superior relative to
the performance of an isolated PF under the same conditions. Notably, the TL-PF performance increases at a faster
rate than the isolated PF as the number of particles increases, which illustrates the higher sensitivity of TL-PF. The
main benefit of the proposed TL-PF approach is that it outperforms not only the isolated PF, but also the integration of
unscented Kalman filter (UKF) [28] and cubature Kalman filter (CKF) [29] with BTLF, which we refer to as transfer
learning unscented Kalman filter (TL-UKF) and transfer learning cubature Kalman filter (TL-CKF) respectively, as
recently published in [30, 31]. This demonstrates the advantages of integrating PF with BTLF to achieve higher
accuracy for the challenges of nonlinear motion tracking in dual-tracking systems.

Organization and Notation
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly presents the dynamical nonlinear motion
model and formulates the problem of tracking an object using a dual-tracking system with a nonlinear model under
asymmetric measurement noise intensities. In Section 3, the BTLF framework is applied to a single object tracking in
a dual-tracking system. Section 4 develops the TL-PF scheme and provides procedural steps of the proposed algorithm
for the source and primary tracking filters. The numerical results of linear and nonlinear scenarios that demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to the related tracking filters are presented in Section 5. In addition

Dynamic System Model for Object Tracking
2.1
Nonlinear Motion Model
Consider a discrete-time dynamical nonlinear system [32] described in a state-space representation by the following
equations:
xk = f (xk−1) + vk−1,
(1)
zk = h (xk) + wk,
(2)
where k ∈N0 denotes the time step of the discrete-time dynamical system. The state of the system at time k is
represented by xk ∈Rnx and f : Rnx →Rnx is a nonlinear state transition function. The measurement of the system
observed at time k is denoted by a vector zk ∈Rnz, which is determined by a nonlinear function h : Rnx →Rnz of
the state vector. The vectors vk−1 ∈Rnx and wk ∈Rnz define the process and measurement noises characterizing
the uncertainty in the dynamical system. The state xk and measurement zk vectors for a particular object tracking
scenario are defined in Section 5.
2.2
Dual-tracking System with Asymmetric Noise Intensities
We consider a dual-tracking system tracking a single object following the nonlinear motion model provided in (1).
The process noise of both sensors is assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) zero-mean Gaussian
vector, expressed as vk−1
iid
∼N(0, Qv), with the same corresponding covariance Qv ∈Rnx×nx for the source and
the primary tracking filters. The two tracking systems track the desired object under the same type of measurement
noise, which is assumed to be Gaussian. However, the environmental and surrounding conditions according to the
location of each tracking system and its FOV are not necessarily the same. This variation in conditions leads to
dissimilar measurement noise intensity that each tracking system experiences. For instance, two self-driving vehicles
driving close to each other in the same area where each may be built by a different manufacturer. As shown in Fig. 1,
the source tracking system measurements are denoted by z⋆
k with superscript ⋆, while the primary tracking system
measurements are denoted by zk.
The measurement model represented in (2) will be separated for the source and primary tracking systems, respectively,
as
z⋆
k = h (xk) + w⋆
k,
(3)
zk = h (xk) + wk,
(4)
where the measurement noises of the source and primary tracking systems are assumed to be i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian,
i.e.,
w⋆
k
iid
∼N(0, Q⋆
w) and wk
iid
∼N(0, Qw),
(5)
respectively. The noise covariances of the measurement model are given by Q⋆
w = I⋆
wBw and Qw = IwBw, where
Bw ∈Rnz×nz is a common diagonal matrix. The noise intensities of the source, I⋆
w ∈R+, and primary, Iw ∈R+,
tracking systems are assumed to be asymmetric, i.e., Iw > I⋆
w, (see Section 5 for more definitions and details). The
higher level of noise intensity at the primary sensor negatively impacts the reliability of its measurements and its
tracking performance. Even though both tracking systems track the same object, their state estimations differ from
each other due to the estimation process of each tracking filter conditioning on different observed measurement, with
various noise intensity. This yields two estimated states where each tracking filter has its own state estimation. The
source tracking filter estimation is denoted by x⋆
k, while the primary tracking filter has an estimated state as xk

Bayesian Transfer Learning Filter Approach
We briefly review the BTLF framework, which was applied in [21,30] in the context of a dual-tracking system based
on the unscented Kalman filter. This framework builds on the concept of shared knowledge introduced in [11, 16]

parameters by transferring the predicted observation parameters, specifically mean ˆη⋆
k+1 and covariance P⋆

from the source tracking filter.
3.1
Source Tracking Filter
In the source tracking filter, an unknown object state, denoted as x⋆
k, of the current time step k and a predicted
observation η⋆
k+1 of the next time step k + 1 are estimated given a set of observed measurements up to time step
k, defined as z⋆
1:k = {z⋆
1, z⋆
2, . . . , z⋆
k}. The overall posterior density of the object state and predicted observation
p(x⋆
k, η⋆
k+1 | z⋆
1:k) is estimated via two posterior densities as (see [30])
p(x⋆
k, η⋆
k+1 | z⋆
1:k) ∝p(x⋆
k | z⋆
1:k) p(η⋆
k+1 | z⋆
1:k),
(6)
where the object state posterior and predicted observation densities are expressed, respectively, as
p(x⋆
k | z⋆
1:k) ∝p(z⋆
k | x⋆
k) p(x⋆
k | x⋆
k−1) p(x⋆

1:k) ∝p(η⋆
k+1 | x⋆
k+1) p(x⋆
k+1 | x⋆
k) p(x⋆
k | z⋆
1:k).
(8)
The parameter of the predicted observation density in (8) along with the predicted observations are transferred to the
primary tracking filter and leveraged in the tracking filter of the next time step to improve tracking accuracy.
3.2
Primary Tracking Filter
The primary tracking filter receives predicted observations up to time step k from the source tracking filter. Given the
set of transferred predicted observations η⋆
2:k and observed measurements up to time step k, the object state posterior
density is estimated as (see [30])
p(xk | z1:k, η⋆
2:k) ∝p(zk | xk) p(η⋆
k | xk) p(xk | xk−1).
(9)
Via (9), the state density is estimated by incorporating transferred predicted observations from the source tracking filter
as prior knowledge. This yields superior performance for the primary sensor, which has less reliable measurements.

Transfer Learning for Particle Filters
We now develop a global approximation approach that integrates particle filtering with a BTLF to approximate pos-
terior densities of the source and primary tracking filters and to leverage the knowledge transferred between tracking

filters. In this section, sequential importance resampling particle filter (SIR-PF) is considered to be the global approach
to approximate, which offers improved estimation accuracy compared to local approaches by relaxing assumptions on
the forms of prior and posterior densities.

where δ(·) is the Dirac delta function. Ideally, the particles in (10) are sampled directly from the posterior density.
Since sampling from the posterior density itself is not possible in most practical scenarios, weighted particles are
simply drawn indirectly from a proposal density, which is known as the importance density and derived in Appendix A,
defined as

k−1) given in (1). This
choice of proposal density was used in [33,34] to simplify the implementation of the PF. According to this common
choice of proposal density, the computation time for sampling from the proposal importance density will be eliminated
by propagating samples of the previous time step through the transition model function. After choosing the importance
density as the state transition prior, the non-normalized weights in (10) and sampled particles in (11) can be obtained,
respectively, as

The resampling step reduces the effect of the degeneracy phenomenon described in [35], which appears after perform-
ing the sequential algorithm for a certain number of iterations. This phenomenon causes most particles to receive
near-zero weight, rendering them ineffective in the approximation process for the posterior density. This method
measures the degeneracy at each time step by computing the effective number of particles Neff, as defined in [33],
and plays an important role once the effective number of particles drops below a certain threshold. The systematic
resampling technique introduced in [36] is performed at every time step in the Sequential Importance Resampling
(SIR) by neglecting particles with low weights and duplicating the higher weighted particles. The new set of particles
is re-weighted uniformly by assigning a new weight w⋆(i)

The above likelihoods, expressed in (31) and (33), are formulated under the assumption of the measurement model
given by (2). Unlike the isolated PF algorithm, TL-PF updates particle weights using transferred density parameters.
These include the mean ˆη⋆
k and its associated covariance P⋆
ηη,k, which are estimated at the previous time step k −1
from the source tracking filter as an additive step introduced mainly for incorporating transferred parameters within
the process of the PF framework in addition to the updating step in (33) and (34) via newly observed measurement zk

tically equal to 1/Ns. The overall state posterior density in (26) is modeled as a Gaussian density, expressed as

Figure 3 shows RMSE results for TL-PF (Ns = 6000 particles) compared with TL-UKF and third-degree TL-CKF.
As shown in Fig. 3, the proposed TL-PF algorithm (blue dashed line with + marks) has lower RMSE values at the
entire duration of the tracked trajectory compared to the isolated PF (blue solid line with + marks). For instance, the
TL-PF is able to achieve RMSE value of 4.28 m at time step k = 52 s, while the isolated PF has RMSE value of
7.37 m at the same time step. Compared with previously proposed algorithms, the TL-UKF (green dashed line with
△marks) and third-degree TL-CKF (red dashed line with □marks) achieve RMSE values of 10.13 m and 11.28 m,
respectively, at the same time step k = 52 s. For the entire duration of the object trajectory in Scenario 1, the TL-
PF algorithm performs better with lower RMSE values compared to comparable algorithms with BTLF and isolated
(without incorporation of the transfer learning approach).

As in Section 2.2, the error process noise covariances of the source and primary tracking filters are assumed to be
identical.
5.2.2
Parameters Settings
The simulation parameter settings for the dual-tracking system are specified in Table 1. The object maneuvers in a
two-dimensional trajectory with a duration of 100 time steps as shown in Fig.4. The object’s state and covariance are
initialized as:
x0 = [1000 m, 300 m/s, 1000 m, 0 m/s, −3◦/s]T ,
(45)
P0 = diag[100 m2, 10 m2/s2, 100 m2, 10 m2/s2,
100 × 10−3 rad2/s2].
(46)
The performance results are evaluated by averaging 10, 000 MC simulation runs. The object trajectory and parameter
settings are identical to the simulation realization in [21, 30] to present a fair comparison with the previous results
obtained from incorporating BTLF into the UKF and CKF local approximation approaches.
5.2.3
Performance Evaluation
Similarly, we evaluate the proposed TL-PF using the tracking Scenario 2 in Fig.4. The performance metric of interest is
the RMSE of the object’s position (xk, yk) for the primary tracking filter. The performance of the proposed TL-PF and
isolated PF are evaluated in terms of RMSE per time step provided in Fig. 5 in addition to isolated and incorporating
transfer learning of local approaches, UKF and third-degree CKF, previously presented in [30]. The proposed TL-PF
algorithm with Ns = 6000 particles (blue dashed line with + marks) achieves RMSE values of 7.85 m and 14.38 m
at time steps k = 48 s and k = 75 s, respectively, under the noise intensities of Iw = 4 (primary sensor) and I⋆
w = 1
(source sensor). In comparison, the isolated version of PF (blue solid line) has RMSE values of 9.73 m and 17.34 m
at the same noise level and time steps. Furthermore, the proposed TL-PF algorithm (with Ns = 6000) achieves an
RMSE of 13.10 m at time step k = 10 s, outperforming the third-degree TL-CKF and TL-UKF (with κ = 2), which
obtain RMSE values of 15.72 m and 14.35 m, respectively, under the same conditions. From Fig. 5, we see that the
performance of the proposed TL-PF is always superior to that of isolated approaches. For most of the trajectory, TL-PF
performs significantly better than TL-CKF and TL-UKF. In the intervals of (20, 40) s and (85, 95) s, TL-PF performs
comparably to TL-CKF and TL-UKF. However, we note that the performance of TL-PF can be further improved by
increasing the number of particles, Ns, at the expense of higher computational cost.
Furthermore, the RMSE curves of the algorithms presented in Fig. 5 have fluctuations in the interval of (40, 75) s.
We compare the performance results from Scenario 1 (Fig. 3 ) with those from Scenario 2 (Fig.5). We note that the

fluctuations in the interval of (40, 75) s are due to the nature of the maneuvering trajectory where the object track
has high maneuvering turns in the same time interval, as obviously shown in Fig. 4. During this time interval, the
proposed TL-PF demonstrates significant strength in capturing object maneuvering turns and estimates the object’s
position more accurately with lower RMSE values compared to other plotted algorithms. For example, the TL-PF
algorithm (with Ns = 6000) achieves an RMSE value of 7.79 m during the high maneuvering turns interval at time
step k = 47 s, while the TL-UKF (green dashed line) has an RMSE value of 13.75 m.
5.2.4
Overall Performance Gain
To further demonstrate the behavior of the proposed TL-PF algorithm, we evaluate its overall RMSE performance,
averaged over 100 time steps and 10, 000 MC iterations, under various levels of primary noise intensity Iw, while
fixing the intensity level of source noise I⋆

As shown in Fig. 6, the accuracy gain of the TL-PF (blue dashed line marked with ∗) compared to the isolated tradi-
tional PF increases as the level of primary noise intensity Iw increases. For instance, under Iw = 4, the TL-PF (with
Ns = 6000) achieves an RMSE value of 14.33 m, while the isolated PF has an RMSE of 16.74 m with a reduction in
estimation error of approximately 2.41 m. Similarly, under Iw = 8, the TL-PF has an RMSE of 17.45 m compared
to 23.06 m for the isolated PF with a reduction of 5.61 m. Furthermore, the TL-PF (with Ns = 6000) outperforms
the fifth-degree TL-CKF (green dashed line with ▽marks) and is capable of achieving an accuracy gain value of
approximately 1.24 m under a level of primary noise intensity Iw = 8.
To investigate the performance gain of incorporating BTLF into several tracking algorithms, we evaluate the primary
tracking position RMSE gain of using BTLF compared to isolated filters calculated as
∆RMSE = RMSEIsolated −RMSETL,

under varying ∆Iw, which is the absolute value of the difference between the primary and source noise intensities
computed as
∆Iw = |Iw −I⋆
w|.
(49)
As shown in Fig. 7, the ∆RMSE for third-degree CKF, UKF, fifth-degree CKF, and PF (with Ns = 6000) increases
as the absolute difference between the primary and source noise intensities ∆Iw increases. This describes the propor-
tional relationship between ∆RMSE and ∆Iw where ∆RMSE increases almost linearly. For instance, at ∆Iw = 3,
the PF (with Ns = 6000) and third-degree CKF achieve ∆RMSE values of 2.41 m and 2.21 m, respectively. However,
the PF (with Ns = 6000) has ∆RMSE value of approximately 5.61 m, which is less than ∆RMSE value of 6.06 m
for the fifth-degree CKF at ∆Iw = 7. We note that the fifth-degree CKF performs significantly better in terms of the
primary tracking position RMSE gain ∆RMSE for most of the absolute difference values between the primary and
source noise intensities ∆Iw, as illustrated in Fig. 7. These ∆RMSE curves can serve as a guideline for whether BTLF
can be incorporated in a certain system depending on the difference between the intensities of the noise.
5.2.5
Varying Particles Number and Computational Time
To investigate the effect of particles number on the accuracy performance of the proposed TL-PF algorithm, we
performed a simulation analysis with varying number of particles Ns = 3000 →12000 under noise intensity levels at
I⋆
w = 1 and Iw = 4. The obtained results, shown in Fig. 8, represent that increasing the number of particles Ns leads
to higher accuracy performance (lower value of RMSE) for both the TL-PF and isolated PF algorithms. This describes
the inverse proportional relationship between the RMSE and the number of particles. Furthermore, the computational
time per time step k, evaluated on a laptop with a 3.1 GHz Core i7 processor, of both the TL-PF (bottom plot with
green dashed line) and isolated PF (top plot with green solid line) is proportional to the number utilized. Moreover, the
sensitivity level of the proposed TL-PF algorithm to the number of particles is greater than the isolated version of PF.
For instance, with Ns = 3000 particles, the TL-PF achieves RMSE of 15.23 m, while the isolated PF has an RMSE
of 16.95 m. By increasing the number of particles to Ns = 12000, the RMSE of TL-PF improves to 14.07 m, while
the RMSE of isolated PF improves only to 16.66 m. As the number of particles increases from 3000 to 12000, the
TL-PF gains an accuracy of 1.16 m compared to 0.29 m for the isolated PF. Table 2 presents a comparative analysis
of local and global approaches integrated with BTLF and their corresponding isolated filters in terms of RMSE and

computational process time per time step. Note that the RMSE results for the first three rows in Table 2, which
represent local approaches, have previously been obtained in [30]. These results are included in this article to provide
a comparative baseline for the proposed algorithm using the global approach. Table 2 shows that integrating of the
global approach, PF, with BTLF achieves a superior reduction in RMSE results compared to RMSE performances of
TL-UKF, third-degree TL-CKF, and fifth-degree TL-CKF. This RMSE improvement comes with a modest increase in
processing time, from 0.296 ms (fifth-degree TL-CKF) to 0.931 ms (TL-PF with Ns = 3000), as shown in Table 2.

Conclusion
We developed a BTL approach for particle filtering, TL-PF, in a dual-tracking system with asymmetric measurement
noise intensities at the primary and source sensors. By leveraging predicted measurement information transferred from
the source sensor, the primary sensor, which experiences the higher noise intensity, is able to achieve a significant gain
in tracking performance compared to an isolated particle filter, without applying transfer learning. We also compared
the performance of the proposed transfer learning particle filter schemes with earlier schemes based on applying
Bayesian transfer learning to the unscented Kalman filter and the cubature Kalman filter, referred to as TL-UKF and
TL-CKF, respectively. Furthermore, the TL-PF shows greater sensitivity to the number of particles compared to the
isolated particle filter. Although increasing the number of particles improves tracking performance, it also increases
computational time, which can be a challenge in real-time processing scenarios. However, a moderate number of
particles can be effectively utilized in certain applications, particularly with the advancements in hardware technology
that allow for greater computational efficiency. For the number of particles Ns = 6000, the process times per step are
approximately 2 ms and 1.9 ms for the TL-PF and the isolated particle filter, respectively. Furthermore , we observe
from the numerical results that the relative gain of the TL-PF is linearly proportional to the absolute difference value
between the source and primary sensors.
For future work, it would be interesting to explore a hybrid system that incorporates a decision step at either the
source or the primary sensor to determine whether to perform transfer learning at each time step. In addition, the
framework can be generalized to involve more than a single source tracking system by transferring predicted observa-

Moreover, the predicted observation η⋆(i)

k, all previous states x(i)
0:k−1, all
previous measurements z1:k−1, and all previous predicted observations η⋆

term on the right-hand side (R.H.S) in (66) can be derived on the basis of the first-order Markov chain assumption as

the numerator in (65) is simplified and rewritten as
