Abstract
Temporally modulated pulsed radiotherapy (TMPRT) delivers conventional fraction doses of
radiation using temporally separated pulses of low doses (<30 cGy) yielding fraction-effective
dose rates of around 6.7 cGy min−1 with the goal to exploit tumor radiation hypersensitivity,
which was observed in both, preclinical models and in human clinical trials. To facilitate
TMPRT, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and 3D-CRT planning techniques were
developed following the guidelines of the proposed NRG CC-017 trial. Plans were evaluated
with respect to HI, conformality, and adherence to dose constraints. Deliverability of plans
was assessed using in-phantom measurements for absorbed dose accuracy at low dose rates
and using EPID for isodose verification. For VMAT only single arc plans were found to
be acceptable due to otherwise unacceptably heterogeneous field doses, while for dynamic
conformal arc machine limtations on the number of monitor units per degree require the
use of partial arcs for each pulse. Delivery of plans at low dose rates (≤100 MU/min) was
accurate with high Γ pass rates on modern LINACs and moderate pass rates on legacy
LINACs, in line with their general performance. Generally, VMAT is preferred to achieve
optimal homogeneity, conformality, and OAR sparing, while the use of 3D-CRT can increase
the availability of TMPRT for more patients and clinics.

1. Introduction
Over the past decades, radiobiologists
and radiation oncologists alike have ob-
served that certain tumors are particularly
sensitive to radiotherapy (RT) delivered

with low-dose rates of <1.67 cGy min−1,1,2
which supported the use of low-dose rate
brachytherapy. This effect was also demon-
strated in preclinical human glioblastoma
(GBM) models where increased G2/M ar-
rest was observed with continuous dose
rates of 0.67 cGy min−1.3,4 Additionally, in-
vestigators at the Gray Laboratory demon-
strated that most tumor cells, including
arXiv:2511.19329v1  [physics.med-ph]  24 Nov 2025

GBM, exhibit hyper-sensitivity to low ra-
diation doses <30 cGy due to a lack of
ATM pathway activation for DNA repair.5–8
These two effects combined have given rise
to a RT technique often referred to as pulsed
low-dose rate, pulsed reduced-dose rate, or
temporally modulated pulsed radiotherapy
(TMPRT), where a conventional fraction
dose of 180 cGy to 300 cGy is delivered
in pulses of approximately 20 cGy, below
the hyper-sensitivity threshold of around
30 cGy and with pulses sufficiently sepa-
rated in time to yield low effective-dose
rates
of
approximately
6.67 cGy min−1.9
Since the instantaneous dose rate of RT
delivery is not changed but rather tem-
porally modulated, TMPRT may be the
more accurate and preferred name for this
technique.
The efficacy of this approach
has been demonstrated in preclinical tumor
models, including GBM.10–12
In addition to preclinical investigation,
TMPRT has been succesfully used at mul-
tiple institutions for reirradiating recur-
rent cranial and extra-cranial tumors.13–22
A prospective, single-arm phase II study
has shown promising clinical efficacy of
the combination of TMPRT and temozolo-
mide (TMZ) on survival, neurocognitive
function, and quality of life in adult pa-
tients with newly diagnosed GBM.23 An-
other prospective, single-arm phase II study
also evaluated TMPRT and TMZ in adult
patients with newly diagnosed GBM and re-
cently completed accrual (NCT04747145).
There are two other prospective single-
arm phase II studies examining TMPRT
with or without concurrent bevacizumab for
reirradiating recurrent high-grade glioma
(NCT01743950)
or
IDH-mutant
glioma
(NCT05393258).
A recently published
evidence-based practice guideline by the
American Society for Radiation Oncology
(ASTRO) endorsed TMPRT as an appro-
priate RT technique for irradiating or reir-
radiating GBM.24
This work is intended as a primer on
the treatment planning aspects for TM-
PRT to facilitate its use, specifically as
part of the proposed NRG CC-017 trial,
a randomized phase III study that com-
pares TMPRT to standard RT in adult
patients with newly diagnosed MGMT-
unmethylated GBM. 3D-conformal radio-
therapy (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated
planning techniques were evaluated and de-
scribed as recipes, complete with plan eval-
uation metrics and measurement-based de-
liverability verification of these low-dose
and low-dose rate pulses on various linear
accelerators (LINACs).
2. Methods
Throughout this manuscript absorbed ra-
diation doses are given in centigray (1 cGy
equal to 0.01 Gy) in keeping with NRG con-
ventions and for consistency with the pro-
posed NRG CC-017 trial.
In TMPRT the fraction dose Dfx is deliv-
ered in discrete radiation pulses separated
in time, resulting in a low fraction-effective
dose rate,
⟨˙D⟩fx =
Dfx
tb,1 −tb,n + ∆t ,
with the beginning of first and last pulses,
tb,1 and tb,n, and the nominal time between
pulses, ∆t. For example, a dose of 200 cGy
delivered in ten pulses, with each pulse start
separated by ∆t of 3 min results in a dose
rate of 6.7 cGy min−1. This formula can also
be used to calculate the minimum treat-
ment session time required for each TMPRT
fraction, which is approximately 30 min in
the example above, excluding patient setup
2

and necessary imaging. For completeness,
one can also consider the immediate effec-
tive dose rate which is the ∆t-moving aver-
age over the delivered dose rate and which
should similarly be below the low-dose rate
threshold,

2.1. Planning techniques
Planning technique for TMPRT were de-
veloped as recipes using the Varian Eclipse
treatment planning system (TPS) for 3D-
CRT (simple & dynamic conformal arc
(DCA)) and volumetric modulated arc ther-
apy (VMAT) such that delivery of one field
corresponds to one pulse. Deliverability and
dose homogeneity over the delivered field in
each pulse were primary goals in addition to
the evaluation metrics described next.
2.2. Evaluation metrics
VMAT plans were generated according
to the planning techniques for three unique
LINACs:
a Varian Trilogy with Milleni-
um-120 multi leaf collimator (MLC), True-
Beam Edge with HD-120 MLC, and Hal-
cyon with its layered SX2 MLC. For 3D-
CRT plans were only generated for the
TrueBeam Edge as no difference in machine
performance is expected for this technique.
Plans were evaluated using target coverage,
homogeneity, and conformity metrics in ad-
dition to any applicable organ at risk (OAR)
constraints.
Here, the target homogene-
ity index (HI) is following the definition in
ICRU 83,25
HI = D2 % −D98 %
D50 %
,
(1)
while conformity is assessed using the Pad-
dick conformality index and its two compo-
nents, the modified PITV ratio (CITV ) and
the overtreatment ratio (CIPIV ):26

The metrics and criteria used here and

TMPRT are summarized in Table 1. Target
and OAR constraints closely follow the pro-
posed NRG-CC017 trial with absolute dose
constraints given in the appendix (Tab. 5).

2.3. Plan delivery measurements
Absolute dose verification was performed
by performing in-phantom ionization cham-
ber measurements using a PTW N31010
on a Varian TrueBeam Edge.
A charge-
to-dose conversion factor was calculated by
using a 10 × 10 cm2 reference field irradia-
tion with 100 MU, which also corrects for
daily output variations. The absorbed dose
was measured at least five times for each
distinct pulse. Measurement-based isodose
verifications were performed for VMAT us-
ing electronic portal imaging device (EPID)
on three linear accelerators: Varian Trilogy,
TrueBeam Edge, and Halcyon.
Measure-
ments on the Trilogy unit were performed
for portal dosimetry plans generated with
3

100 MU/min and 600 MU/min as set dose
rates.
3. Results
3.1. Planning recipes
The following recipes were developed for
both fractionation regimen in NRG-CC017,
4600 cGy to 6000 cGy in 200 cGy fractions
(conventional) and 4000 cGy in 15 fractions
(hypofractionation). For any other regimen
one may follow the same overall approach.
Field dose rates should be set to the larger
of 100 MU/min or the lowest available for
the machine. Field normalization for dose
calculation should be set to 100 % at isocen-
ter when available in the TPS.
3.1.1. VMAT with single arc
Enable TPS features to increase conver-
gence requirements to improve plan qual-
ity for this single arc configuration (e.g.,
for Eclipse set convergence mode:
"Ex-
tended" and restart from MR level: MR3).
While the collimator rotation may be cho-
sen freely, alignment more perpendicular to
the arc plane will allow for improved modu-
lation, especially for targets with OAR over-
lap in the inferior direction.
For conventional fractionation, create a
plan with 20 cGy/fx and 230 fractions (70
for boost) for a total dose of 4600 cGy
(1400 cGy) using a single full arc with a
control point spacing not exceeding 2° (or
whichever the minimum is for the TPS and
treatment machine).
Optimization of the
plan may be done as usual with the ex-
ception that the number of arcs must stay
fixed at one. After plan normalization the
single arc is copied for a total of ten arcs
with the arc direction reversed on alternat-
ing arcs (Tab. S1). Subsequently, the plan is
recalculated with fixed monitor units (MUs)
for a prescription of 200 cGy/fx and 23 frac-
tions (7 for boost).
Each arc within the
200 cGy/fx plan is then delivering one pulse
of 20 cGy. The resulting dose distribution
for an example single arc VMAT plan is
shown in the left column of Figure 1.
For hypofractionation, create a plan with
20.5 cGy/fx and 195 fractions for a total
dose of 3997.5 cGy and follow the same pro-
cedure except for duplicating the arcs for
a total of 13 and recalculating with fixed
MUs for a prescription of 4000 cGy in 15
fractions.
This yields a plan where each
arc is delivering a pulse of 20.5 cGy. Where
it is not possible to enter fractional values
of centigray, normalization of the final plan
should achieve appropriate dosing.
3.1.2. 3D-DCA with two half arcs
For conventional fractionation, create a
plan with 40 cGy/fx and 115 fractions (35
for boost) for a total dose of 4600 cGy
(1400 cGy) using two half arcs with a con-
trol point spacing not exceeding 5° (or as
above) and a weighting of 50 % each. Af-
ter dose calculation and normalization, cre-
ate copies of each arc for a total of ten arcs
with the arc direction reversed on alternat-
ing arcs and their weights set to 10 %. The
plan is then recalculated with fixed MUs
for a prescription of 200 cGy/fx as above
(Tab. S1). The resulting dose distribution
for an example DCA plan is shown in the
center column of Figure 1.
For hypofractionation, create a plan with
38 cGy/fx and 105 fractions and follow the
same steps except for duplicating the arcs
for a total of 14 and recalculating with fixed
MUs for a prescription of 4000 cGy in 15
fractions.

static 3D-CRT (right) plan to 1400 cGy. For each two separate axial planes are shown in rows. Structures
delineated in red and light blue are PTV4600 and PTV6000, respectively. Colorwash levels are chosen as
110 %, 105 %, 100 %, 95 %, 90 %, and 50 % of the respective prescription doses; yellow corresonds to 100 %.
3.1.3. 3D with static fields and accessories
Create a plan with 200 cGy/fx and 23
fractions (7 for boost) for conventional frac-
tionation and with 267 cGy/fx and 15 frac-
tions for hypofractionation.
Place three
fields based on target geometry and avoid-
ance of overlapping OARs.
Before manipulating the fields, a pulse
distribution for the three fields must be cho-
sen. There are 10 pulses for conventional
fractionation and 13 to 14 for hypofraction-
ation.
The number of pulses assigned to
each field determines its weight to be en-
tered e.g., four pulses in conventional frac-
tionation correspond to a weight of 40 %
whereas four out of 14 pulses in hypofrac-
tionation corresponds to a weight of 4/14, or
≈28.6 %. Examples of pulse assignment and
corresponding field weights are given in Ta-
ble 2. After pulse assignment and weighting
the fields may be manipulated using acces-
sories like wedges, field-in-field, or electronic
compensator. With the latter, care must be
taken to keep the relative field weights equal
to maintain the same dose delivered in each
pulse.
Once an acceptable plan has been gener-
ated, each of the fields should be copied ac-
cording to its pulse assignment. For exam-
ple, a field with 4/10 pulses will be copied
for total of 4 identical fields or a field with
5/14 pulses will be copied for a total of 5

For conventional fractionation this means
that each field will have a weight of 10 %.
The resulting dose distribution for an ex-
ample static 3D-CRT boost plan is shown
in the right column of Figure 1.
3.2. Plan evaluation metrics
Plans were created for conventional frac-
tionation including the initial and boost
plans. VMAT was used on three different
units whereas for 3D-CRT only one set of
plans was created using DCA for the initial
and static fields for the boost plan.
Most plans complied with ideal con-
straints and achieved similar heterogeneity
and conformity metrics tabulated in Ta-
ble 3. Where they did not acceptable vari-
ations were met for D10 % and D0.03 cm3. In
order to comply with dose constraints for
brainstem, optic chiasm and nerves, the
3D-CRT boost plan did not achieve full
coverage as indicated by the low CITV ; it
did, however, achieve the protocol’s vari-
ation acceptable for D95 %. Homogeneities
in VMAT plans treating the 4600 cGy and
6000 cGy volumes were ≤0.8 and ≤0.13, re-
spectively.
In these plans CI Paddick were
≥0.91 and ≥0.84 with differences driven by
variations in CIPIV .
3.3. Plan delivery measurements
Ionization
chamber
measurements
for
each pulse of the plans described above are
given in Table 4. Deviations from the ex-
pected mean dose at the chamber area were
within 1.4 % for all plans and pulses. Mea-
surement variations over at least five repli-
cates per configuration were 1 % or less.
The average fractions of points in the
EPID measurements with Γ(1 %, 1 mm) < 1
were 91.0(1) %, 97.2(2) %, and 88.9(16) %
for the TrueBeam Edge, Halcyon, and Tril-
ogy units, respectively. Only points above
a 10 % dose threshold were included in the
analysis and dose distributions were nor-
malized to maximum dose. When increas-
ing to a clinically more commonly used dose
difference threshold of 2 %, these increased
to 96.2(3) %, 99.2 %, and 96.8(8) %. On the
Trilogy unit, the plan created with the high-
est set dose rate available had 28.3(40) %
and 94.3(10) % of points with Γ < 1 for dose
difference thresholds of 1 % and 5 %, respec-
tively.
4. Discussion
4.1. Planning recipes
Several beam geometries were initially
considered for VMAT, specifically two arcs
with complementary collimator angles in
addition to the single arc setup discussed
here. Using complementary collimator an-
gles results in substantially increased de-
grees of freedom for the optimization, e.g.,
Ndof(0, 90◦) ∼Ndof(0)×Ndof(90◦) compared
to Ndof(0, 0) ∼2 Ndof(0). This is typically
desirable to simultaneously improve target

dose conformality and homogeneity, and
critical OAR avoidance.
We found, how-
ever, that this can lead to substantial dif-
ferences in field doses of each arc as shown
in Figures 2 and S1.
Furthermore, it is
commonly not possible to apply optimiza-
tion constraints on homogeneity to indvid-
ual fields (as this would also run counter
to improving the Ndof), nor is a per-field
dose evaluation commonly performed in the
TPS. This poses an issue for TMPRT where
each pulse is supposed to deliver a portion of
the fraction dose, around 15 cGy to 25 cGy,
to exploit radiation hypersensitivity.
Re-
viewing the anatomy of several GBM cases
informed the recommendation to use colli-
mator angles that result in the MLC leaves
moving along the superior-inferior direction
i.e., around 90° (IEC scale).
Splitting the DCA delivery into two half
arcs was required due to machine limita-
tions on all considered units, specifically
the lower limit for delivered monitor units
per degree.
On the more modern True-
Beam Edge and Halcyon systems this limit
is 0.1 MU/°, while for older units like the
Trilogy it may be higher (0.3 MU/°). Other
manufacturers’ LINACs may have similar
limitations, which must be considered in-
dividually when commissioning TMPRT.
While this limit also applies to VMAT arcs
they typically require more than 36 MU to
accommodate modulation.
In contrast to
the two-arc VMAT solution, however, us-

ing two DCAs did not yield substantially
different field doses as shown in Figures 2
and S2. Profiles along the anterior-posterior
and superior-inferior directions were almost
identical.
Only in the left-right direction
a gradient was observed across the field,
which is expected since the delivery consists
of partial arcs covering the left and right
hemispheres.
A similar behavior was ob-
served for the static 3D-CRT plan with field
doses and profiles shown in Figure S3.
VMAT using a single arc presents the
overall best treatment planning and deliv-
ery technique for TMPRT due to its flexibil-
ity in achieving conformal and homogeneous
dose distributions and simultaneous OAR
sparing.
3D-CRT techniques can provide
an acceptable fallback solution where insur-
ance or technical limitations (no VMAT ca-
pability) exist. While helical tomotherapy
delivery is excluded in the proposed trial,
users of those units may refer to a previous
publication for off-trial treatments.27,28
4.2. Achieved plan metrics
Despite the constraints of using only one
VMAT arc high plan quality was achieved
for the three diverse LINACs, each using a
different MLC model. There was no clear
trend of either units yielding better plan
metrics (Tab. 3).
For 3D-CRT a combination of DCA and
static fields with dynamic wedges and sub-
fields was chosen primarily to demonstrate
both planning techniques.
The utility of
DCA strongly depends on the target shape
8

but requires less planning effort to gener-
ate a mostly uniform dose distribution com-
pared to static fields. On the other hand,
sparing of critical OARs like optic struc-
tures and the brainstem, which are often
adjacent or encompassed in the target mar-
gins is often more easily accomplished using
static fields with MLC manipulation.
While the recommendations presented
are based on a single patient’s geometry,
we reviewed several patients to select the
most challenging target geometry with re-
spect to total volume, shape, and overlap
with critical OARs. In any case, it will be
important to consider each patient’s indi-
vidual anatomy in the planning process.
4.3. Plan delivery measurements
Agreement between measured point doses
and TPS values in high dose, low gra-
dient areas showed that treatment deliv-
ery at low dose rates of 100 MU/min (or
lower during VMAT) is consistent and per
plan. Differences for VMAT delivery were
higher than for DCA but not larger than
1.4 %, highlighting that MLC position un-
certainty, dose rate and gantry speed vari-
ations are likely to have negligible impact.
Uncertainties in the position and attenua-
tion properties of the used support struc-
tures could contribute to the observed dif-
ferences, which is corroborated by the larger
variation being observed for the posterior
wedged field (A1) in static 3D-CRT.
Portal dosimetry modes on the more
modern TrueBeam and Halcyon units use
a single calibration factor across all dose
rates. This is possible since their EPID re-
sponse does not vary substantially across
the typical range of dose rates in con-
ventional RT. This is supported by the
high Γ-pass rates for VMAT plans with
average dose rates of ≈100 MU/min com-
pared to the typical calibration dose rate of
400 MU/min to 600 MU/min. In contrast,
on older units like the Trilogy EPID dosime-
try modes uses individual calibration fac-
tors for each possible set dose rate due to
an increased dose rate dependence. While
the choice of set dose rate does not af-
fect plan optimization or delivery, it affects
EPID dosimetry accuracy. This was demon-
stranted by the large difference between
Γ-pass rates for 600 MU/min (28 %) and
100 MU/min (94 %) set dose rates, where in
both cases the machine delivered dose rate
was fluctuating around 100 MU/min. It is
thus recommended to choose the set dose
rate closest to the expected average.
5. Conclusions
Treatment planning for TMPRT was
shown to be feasible with single-arc VMAT
and 3D-CRT. VMAT is preferred to achieve
optimal homogeneity,
conformality,
and
OAR sparing.
Measurement-based plan
verification of low-dose rate field/pulse de-
livery showed that both modern and legacy
LINACs are capable to deliver TMPRT
plans with high fidelity.
