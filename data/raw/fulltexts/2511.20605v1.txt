How to Purchase Labels? A Cost-effective Approach Using Active
Learning Markets

Pierre Pinson†
Abstract
We introduce and analyse active learning markets as a way to purchase labels, in situations where
analysts aim to acquire additional data to improve model fitting, or to better train models for predictive
analytics applications.
This comes in contrast to the many proposals that already exist to purchase
features and examples. By originally formalizing the market clearing as an optimization problem, we
integrate budget constraints and improvement thresholds into the label acquisition process. We focus
on a single-buyer-multiple-seller setup and propose the use of two active learning strategies (variance
based and query-by-committee based), paired with distinct pricing mechanisms. They are compared to
a benchmark random sampling approach. The proposed strategies are validated on real-world datasets
from two critical application domains: real estate pricing and energy forecasting. Results demonstrate
the robustness of our approach, consistently achieving superior performance with fewer labels acquired
compared to conventional methods. Our proposal comprises an easy-to-implement practical solution for
optimizing data acquisition in resource-constrained environments.

Introduction
In today’s data-driven economy, data is often referred to as the “new oil”, reflecting its critical role in
driving technological innovation and economic growth. The global market for data analytics is projected
to expand significantly in the coming years, growing from USD 348.21 billion in 2024 to USD 924.39
billion in 2032, with a compound annual growth rate of 13.9% [Fortune Business Insights, 2023]. The
rapid proliferation of data, generated on massive scales daily, has paved the way for advances in big data
analytics, offering innovative solutions in areas such as transportation, energy, real estate, and healthcare,
among others. As an example, in the UK, Citymapper leverages freely available real-time transportation data
to enhance urban navigation and improve public transport efficiency [Tavmen, 2020]. However, in many
cases, the ownership of data is distributed among heterogeneous agents, while data is deemed a commodity
that must be strategically acquired. For instance, as businesses increasingly recognize the importance of
predictive capabilities, many face the challenge of acquiring the necessary volume and quality of data to
train machine learning models. It is of utmost importance to develop appropriate platforms and market
ecosystems supporting the sharing, valuation, and acquisition of data.
To set the scene, consider the following two scenarios. First, an analyst in a real estate company wants
to train a model to predict house prices in a certain area. The analyst has access to all transactions history
of houses from their company. Also, in order to have more training data, they may obtain information

about other houses with different characteristics (e.g., numbers of rooms, distance to local transportation and
schools, etc.). However, the corresponding labels (i.e., the actual prices at which these houses were sold) may
not be public, while being necessary for training. How should the analyst decide which labels to acquire and
at what price? Second, an analyst in the energy sector aims to build a model to forecast energy consumption
for an educational building using time-series data from various sources. Data from other buildings (labels)
could be very useful to additionally train the model. Given a limited budget, what strategy should be used
to acquire these additional labels?
In a general setup, we place ourselves in a supervised learning framework, where data for input features
(equivalently referred to as explanatory variables) may be abundant, while the availability of labels (i.e.,
values for the target variable) is limited. To develop the idea and a proof of concept, we specifically use
linear regression. Linear regression has many practical advantages, including simplicity, interpretability,
and the availability of a closed-form solution for parameter estimates. Furthermore, linear regression has
also been used by others as a basis to introduce various types of data markets [Dekel et al., 2010, Cummings
et al., 2015a], which produces important market properties such as incentive compatibility and truthfulness.
However, one should be able to broaden the concepts presented to a class of models that is more general
than linear regression only. For instance, as discussed by Pinson et al. [2022], data markets developed
for the linear regression case can be readily generalized to the case of regression models that are linear in
their parameters; this includes, for instance, polynomial- and spline-based regression. In our framework, an
analyst seeks to acquire additional labels to improve model fitting, or to improve the predictive performance
of the model at hand. These may be highly dependent on the availability and quality of the labels that are
used. Labels may be difficult or costly to obtain.
Existing approaches to data and information markets fall into various categories. Given an analytics task
at hand, one may purchase solutions for that task (as in prediction markets), or one may purchase actual data
to be used as input to solving that analytics task. For descriptive and predictive analytics, this may translate
to having (i) observation markets and (ii) feature markets (also referred to as regression markets). In the first
case, the buyer aims to acquire complete rows (with values for both input features and the target variable) to
have more data to train their model. In the second case, emphasis is placed on purchasing additional features
(i.e., complete columns) to augment the model at hand and to improve their ability to explain variations in
the target variable. These markets have been extensively studied [Agarwal et al., 2019, Pinson et al., 2022]
and are mainly based on Shapley values to define revenues and payments. Alternatively, Han et al. [2022]
proposed the use of Lasso-based estimation to elicit the willingness to pay of data buyers. Moreover, existing
research often emphasizes bulk data acquisition or continuous data delivery, such as in Data as a Commodity
(e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk) or Data as a Service (e.g., Google BigQuery). These approaches fall
short of addressing the need for targeted and cost-effective data acquisition, especially for machine learning
applications where high-quality, informative data points are more valuable than large quantities of generic
data. At the same time, the growing presence of platforms such as AWS Data Exchange, Ocean Protocol, and
crowdsourcing markets like Amazon Mechanical Turk demonstrates that market-style procurement of data is
already a practical reality. What remains unexplored is how to integrate active learning principles into these
emerging markets to guide selective, budget-constrained acquisition of the most informative labels—which
is the gap this paper addresses.
In contrast, here, we introduce a new type of data market to specifically purchase labels. We refer
to such markets as active learning markets, since active learning serves as a basis for acquiring labels in a
value-oriented manner. In active learning markets, buyers possess full feature sets, but only a subset of values
for the target variable of interest. This calls for strategic acquisition of additional labels to improve model
performance. This setup closely mirrors real-world scenarios faced by companies where the resources for
data acquisition (for the target variable) may be limited. Despite advances in data monetization and pricing
models [Agarwal et al., 2019, Mehta et al., 2021], frameworks often overlook budget constraints and fail
to propose efficient strategies for buyers to prioritize high-value data points. Furthermore, although studies
2

such as Cummings et al. [2015b] propose variance-constrained mechanisms for data selection, they do not
accommodate budget constraints and strategic selection of the data to be purchased. This gap is particularly
pronounced in industries such as energy forecasting, where data acquisition is expensive, but essential to
achieve high prediction accuracy [Wang et al., 2023, Settles, 2011].
We bridge this research gap by introducing and analyzing active learning markets. Our core contribution
is then to incorporate both overall budget constraints and minimum improvement requirements in data
acquisition problems.
This dual consideration is a departure from traditional data purchase problems.
Second, we extend the use of the active learning principle within a data market context.
Eventually,
we showcased the interest of our proposal based on case studies inspired by real-world applications. To
realize these contributions, we first define the market setup, introducing the market participants and the
key components of the underlying resource allocation problem. We then formalize that resource allocation
problem within an optimization framework. Rather than solving this optimization problem directly, we use
active learning as a greedy approach to data acquisition. This is based on two alternative active learning
strategies (variance-based active learning, VBAL, and query-by-committee-based active learning, QBCAL),
each paired with distinct data pricing mechanisms. For comparison, we used a random sampling corrected
strategy as a benchmark. To validate our proposed strategies, we apply them to real-world datasets in two
critical domains: real estate pricing and energy forecasting. Through these applications, we analyse and
discuss the salient features of active learning markets, with the aim of underlining their practical value in
optimizing data acquisition under various constraints.
The remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the preliminaries of data markets
in general and of active learning markets in particular. Section 3 provides an overview of our active learning
marketplace and details our VBAL-based and QBCAL-based approaches while using random sampling
corrected strategy as a benchmark. Section 4 presents our proposal for the active learning market for 2
different real-world applications and discusses the results from the perspective of both the analyst and the
sellers. Section 5 concludes the work while offering perspectives for future work.

Introducing active learning markets
After briefly discussing current challenges within data valuation, we introduce how active learning markets
fit within the current landscape of data markets for analytics applications. We subsequently describe market
participants, the core optimization problem for purchasing labels, and related pricing considerations.
2.1
Data valuation
Data, as an asset, has three unique characteristics that distinguish it from traditional goods, each presenting
its own set of challenges. First, data can be easily replicated at zero cost, introducing new issues in data
pricing [Acemoglu et al., 2022, Mehta et al., 2021, Liang et al., 2018, Pei, 2020, Yu and Zhang, 2017, Li et al.,
2014]. Second, data is generated in vast volumes and at high velocity. For instance, according to Statista
[2024], the data generated in 2025 is estimated at reaching 181 zettabytes, increased by more than 150%
compared to the data generated in 2023—120 zettabytes. This massive scale creates significant challenges
for big data analytics [Maheshwari et al., 2021, Mariani and Wamba, 2020, Wang and Wang, 2020]. Third,
data ownership is distributed by companies, each with heterogeneous preferences due to differing privacy
concerns and competitive dynamics [Abbas et al., 2021, Busch-Casler and Radic, 2022, OECD, 2018].
Addressing these challenges requires new paradigms for data marketplaces, particularly given that the
value of data is not intrinsic, but highly dependent on its context—its quality, timeliness, and relevance to
specific analytics tasks.

2.2
Alternative data market setups
One can think of data markets for analytics in different ways, depending on the type of data to be acquired
and the way they may be used as input to analytics tasks. Data purchase generally refers to the acquisition
of additional data points from data sellers against some form of monetary transaction. Analysts may engage
in data purchase to improve the fit of their model and to improve the predictive performance of their model.
Within a supervised learning framework, let Ω = {1, . . . , 𝑃} index the set of input features. For each
𝑝∈Ω, the 𝑝-th input feature is denoted by 𝑥𝑝(also referred to as an explanatory variable).
Let 𝑌denote
the target variable (also known as response variable). As a basis for introducing data markets, we restrict
ourselves to a simpler linear regression framework. The notation 𝑥is used for the observations of the features
in Ω and 𝑦for the observed values of the target variable 𝑌. Let 𝑁denote the total number of observations,
for both input features and response variable. We start by introducing two cases which have already been
explored within the scientific literature, before introducing our novel framework.

Figure 1: Graphical representations of observation, feature and active learning markets, based on both design
matrix and response vector (grey: data/features owned by the buyer; white: data/features the sellers may
offer).
In the first case, which we refer to as observation market, the analyst may already own, or have access to,
a number of observations for both explanatory variables and the response variable they are interested in. This
situation is illustrated in Figure 1 (a). There, the analyst already has the first 𝐾rows and may be interested
in purchasing additional rows (from the 𝑁−𝐾they do not have already). In the second case, which we
refer to as feature market (the term regression market has also been used in the literature, see Pinson et al.
[2022], for instance), the analyst has access to all 𝑁observations for 𝑀input features, as well as for the
response variable of interest. The analyst may then be interested in purchasing additional columns, i.e., data
for additional 𝑃−𝑀potential features that they do not already have access to.
An example of the observation market is that of an e-commerce site (e.g. Amazon) predicting customer
lifetime value, where available observations consist of past purchases, frequency purchases, and customer
demographics. The analyst may be interested in purchasing additional data for these same features from
another e-commerce site (e.g., Shein). With more comprehensive data available, the analyst may improve
the fit of their model(s) and/or improve their generalizability. In parallel, for the feature market, an example
is that of two wind farms buying data from each other. Each wind farm will have their own features, e.g.,
local measurements and weather forecasts, and may be interested in purchasing measurements and weather
forecasts from the other wind farm.
In contrast, here we introduce active learning markets (which may be equivalently seen as label markets).
We define 𝐷L the labelled data that the analyst already has access to (including observations for both
explanatory and target variables), 𝐷U the unlabelled data that is either owned by data sellers or can be
obtained (e.g., through public sources), and 𝐷ML the missing labels that are owned exclusively by data
sellers. The analyst is interested in purchasing some of these labels. An example active learning market is
illustrated in Figure 1(c), based on the following sets of data:
4

𝐷L = {(𝑥1𝑖, 𝑥2𝑖, . . . , 𝑥𝑃𝑖, 𝑦𝑖) , 𝑖= 1, 2, . . . , 𝐾} ,

,
(1b)
𝐷ML =

𝑦𝑗, 𝑗= 𝐾+ 1, . . . , 𝑁
	
.
(1c)
where 𝐾< 𝑁. Here, the data analyst has 𝐷L and 𝐷U with all the features for all 𝑁observations, while the
data sellers have 𝐷ML with the target variables for 𝑁−𝐾observations.
2.3
Active learning market: Participants
In the active learning market, let 𝐴represent the data analyst and 𝑆𝑗(𝑗= 1, 2, . . . , 𝑚) the data sellers, where
𝑚= 𝑁−𝐾denotes the total number of data sellers and each seller has a unique label 𝑦𝑗∈𝐷ML. In the
more general case, there may be fewer than 𝑚sellers and they may own more than 1 label each. However,
this does not change the market setup in any way, and we consider this simpler setup in which each seller has
a single label only for simplicity.
The data analyst 𝐴works with several defined components. Note that we use the term data analyst for the
data buyer, to be consistent with the terminology used by, e.g., Cummings et al. [2015b]. Identified data 𝐷L
comprises the data set owned by the analyst, including both features and their corresponding target values
(that is, the corresponding labels). The unlabelled data 𝐷U consists of data points that the analyst can access,
covering values for all relevant features, but without associated labels for the target variable of interest. The
analyst is willing to pay (WTP) 𝜙, which represents what the analyst is ready to spend (per unit cost, e.g., £,
$, ¥) for a unit improvement in some model performance metric 𝐿. For instance, both the variance of model
estimates and the mean square error of model-based forecasts will be used in the following. Here, we treat 𝜙
as a constant, reflecting ex-ante scenarios in which the analyst has no prior information to differentiate among
candidate labels and therefore sets a uniform value for performance improvement. This simplification follows
the tradition of single-parameter environments in mechanism design, where each participant’s valuation or
cost is summarized by a single scalar parameter (e.g., Ghosh and Roth [2011], Cummings et al. [2015a],
Agarwal et al. [2019]). Such models provide tractability while still capturing key buyer–seller interactions.
In practice, this corresponds to organizations that translate forecast errors into well-defined financial costs
(e.g., inventory misallocation or excess capacity), which naturally yield a constant willingness to pay per unit
of accuracy. Additionally, our analysis is conducted in the batch active learning setting; therefore, the buyer’s
willingness to pay (WTP) is assumed constant over time rather than dynamically updated. The potential
variation of WTP in online or adaptive settings is discussed in Section 5.2. The analyst also establishes a
model performance threshold 𝛼, which defines the maximum expected decrease in the model performance
metric (assuming that the metric is negatively oriented) for which they are ready to pay. In parallel, the data
purchase budget 𝐵specifies the maximum amount the analyst may be able to spend to purchase data.
Data sellers, on the other hand, are characterized by the labels they own, gathered in the set 𝐷ML, which
are made available to the analyst for purchase. These labels are not shared with the analyst prior to the
purchase, since active learning will allow one to decide which label the analyst wants to acquire, without
having used that label yet. Each data seller has a willingness to sell (WTS), denoted 𝜂𝑗, which represents
the minimum price each seller is willing to accept for their label 𝑦𝑗.
2.4
How the market operates
Having defined the participants and their attributes, we now formalize the operation of the market. The
mechanism must determine both the allocation of labels to be purchased and the corresponding prices.
Formally, the market operates as a mapping F 𝑎
𝐿, which, based on input data 𝐷L, 𝐷U, 𝐷ML and given the
(linear) regression model M chosen by the analyst and the loss function 𝑙of interest, performs both resource
5

allocation (i.e., choosing the labels to be purchased and from which seller) and pricing of these labels, i.e.,
F 𝑎
𝐿: (𝐷L, 𝐷U, 𝐷ML; M, 𝑙) → 𝐷ac
ML, p
(2)
where 𝐷ac
ML ⊆𝐷ML is the set of data eventually purchased and transferred to the analyst, while p = {𝑝𝑗| 𝑦𝑗∈
𝐷ac
ML} is the set of prices for these labels, used as a basis for defining revenues and payments for both analysts
and sellers.
At the core of the resource allocation problem is the label purchase decision. It involves a binary variable
𝑧𝑗, which is used to indicate whether the label is purchased or not. The rule is such that the improvement 𝑙𝑗
in the loss function 𝑙has to be greater than a threshold defined by the label price and the analyst’s willingness
to pay, for the label to be purchased. This writes
𝑧𝑗=


1,
𝑙𝑗≥𝜂𝑗
𝜙
0,
otherwise
(3)
Regarding the pricing of the labels actually purchased, we consider two alternatives which are to be seen
as the most extreme cases. That is, the pricing can be based either on the buyer or on the offer from the seller.
In a single-buyer-multiple seller setup, one cannot rely on supply-demand equilibrium concepts, as would be
the case for more general resource allocation problems with multiple buyers and multiple sellers. Here, in a
seller-centric pricing approach (SC), the price is defined as 𝑝𝑗= 𝜂𝑗, which corresponds to the willingness
to sell for the label 𝑦𝑗. Following a buyer-centric (BC) pricing approach, instead, each purchased label 𝑦𝑗is
priced as 𝑝𝑗= 𝜙𝑙𝑗, i.e., reflecting the willingness to pay 𝜙and the perceived value of the label 𝑙𝑗. These two
approaches can be seen as extreme cases since labels will only be purchased if 𝜙𝑙𝑗≥𝜂𝑗, and then any price
𝑝𝑗∈[𝜂𝑗, 𝜙𝑙𝑗] could be acceptable to both both buyer and the seller. As a by-product of market clearing, the
analyst can estimate a set of parameters ˆ𝜃(𝐷L, 𝐷U, 𝐷ac
ML) based on their own data, as well as acquired labels,
for their regression model. The analyst also deduces the estimate of the overall loss function by acquiring
𝐷ac
ML ⊆𝐷ML. We write 𝑙𝑗the loss reduction induced by acquiring the label 𝑦𝑗.
In principle, acquiring the labels 𝑦𝑗∈𝐷ac
ML leads to an overall reduction Δ𝐿in the loss function of
interest. It can be expressed as
Δ𝐿= 𝐿(𝐷L, 𝐷U; M, 𝑙) −𝐿(𝐷L, 𝐷U, 𝐷ac
ML; M, 𝑙)
(4)
where the first and second terms are the overall loss values before and after acquiring the labels in 𝐷ac
ML,
respectively. In the following, the type of loss functions we will consider will include the variance of
parameter estimates and the generalized prediction performance (i.e., Mean Squared error, MSE, on a
validation set).
2.5
Data purchase as an optimisation problem
Based on the data market framework introduced in Section 2.2, we then formulate our simplified label
acquisition problem. Consider a data analyst who wishes to purchase labels from a set of sellers to improve
some negatively-oriented metric 𝑙(the lower, the better) related to their regression model (e.g., variance
of parameter estimates or some measure of prediction error). The key challenge is to decide which labels
𝑦𝑗∈𝐷ML should be acquired. Conceptually, assuming that each data point contributes with an additive
improvement 𝑙𝑗, we have a combinatorial optimization problem with budget constraints. Indeed, the data
analyst has a budget limit 𝐵and an expected threshold 𝛼for the reduction of the loss function. In practical
applications, those constraints can be excessively strict, potentially leading to an insufficient number of
purchased data points. To mitigate this issue, we relax the constraints as either the budget or loss function
threshold is met. Therefore the simplified setup can be defined as

(5f)
where the price 𝑝𝑗is defined as 𝑝𝑗= 𝜙𝑙𝑗or 𝑝𝑗= 𝜂𝑗, following the BC and SC pricing approaches,
respectively (as expressed in (5d)). Problem (5) is intentionally presented as a simplified, stylized abstraction
of the label-purchase process. Its additive and separable structure assumes that the benefits from purchasing
labels can be written as Í
𝑗𝑧𝑗𝑙𝑗. This is, of course, a simplification: in real-world data-purchase settings,
the value of data is typically state-dependent—the contribution of label 𝑗depends on which other labels
have already been acquired—and information may be shared across labels. Hence, the effective contribution
of label 𝑗is generally a function of (𝑧1, . . . , 𝑧𝑗), and market participants may behave strategically. The
formulation in (5) therefore does not aim to capture the full richness of market dynamics; rather, it serves as
an analytically tractable benchmark that highlights the allocation trade-offs that motivate our active-learning
framework.
Although the simplified structure in (5) superficially resembles a knapsack formulation, applying knap-
sack algorithms directly is infeasible in our setting. Knapsack methods—exact, approximate, or heuristic
[Martello and Toth, 1990, Bourdache and Perny, 2019]—all require that the utilities of all items be known
in advance. In our context, these utilities correspond to the realised improvement from labeling each point,
which can only be observed after the label has been purchased. This makes classical knapsack approaches
unsuitable for strategic and limited label acquisition. Moreover, even if approximate utilities were available,
the combinatorial nature of the problem combined with the scale of modern datasets renders exact solvers
and approximation schemes computationally burdensome. In contrast, active learning provides a scalable
and adaptive alternative: it uses estimators of label utility that can be updated as labels are acquired, without
requiring all labels to be observed upfront [Cacciarelli and Kulahci, 2024]. While knapsack algorithms offer
strong optimality guarantees when item utilities are fully known, this assumption is unrealistic here. Active
learning trades global optimality guarantees for adaptability and computational feasibility, making it more
practical for real-world large-scale label acquisition tasks.
2.6
Market properties
The proposed active learning market adheres to the following desirable market properties.
(i) Budget Balance
A market is budget-balanced if the sum of revenues on the seller side is equal to the sum of payments on
the buyer side. In a single-buyer-multiple-seller setup like ours, for both pricing approaches considered, it
is straightforward to see that the buyer readily pays the sellers on an individual label basis, ensuring budget
balance by construction in (5a). The market is then budget-balanced by design.
(ii) Symmetry
7

Symmetry holds if sellers with identical contributions 𝑙𝑗and identical willingness-to-sell 𝜂𝑗are treated
equivalently. From our definition of prices in (5d), i.e.,
𝑝𝑗=
(
𝜙𝑙𝑗,
buyer-centric pricing
𝜂𝑗,
seller-centric pricing
(6)
we can see that if 𝑙𝑗= 𝑙′
𝑗and 𝜂𝑗= 𝜂′
𝑗, then 𝑝𝑗= 𝑝′
𝑗. Moreover, the selection decision in (5f) depends solely
on 𝑙𝑗, 𝜂𝑗and 𝜙, ensuring that there is no preference in the case of having sellers with identical information
and willingness to sell.
Note that symmetry holds only in the simplified formulation of (5). In our active
learning market, utilities are updated adaptively, so if two labels contain similar information, acquiring one
naturally reduces the marginal value of the other. As a result, exact symmetry does not persist in practice—an
expected and even beneficial property, as it discourages spending on labels that add little new information.
We emphasise that the symmetry discussed here is a property of the stylised optimisation formulation, not
an assumed behavioural property of the active learning process itself.
(iii) Truthfulness.
Truthfulness, also referred to as incentive compatibility, is the property such that, for all agents involved,
it is a weakly dominant strategy to truthfully reveal their preferences through the market mechanism. Our
setting does not aim to fully model strategic behaviour; rather, we use “truthfulness” in an operational sense:
under the simple market rules we adopt, deviating from truthful reporting does not increase a participant’s
expected payoff. Here, this would translate into sellers providing their true labels while revealing their true
willingness to sell. On the buyer’s side, this would translate to truthfully revealing their willingness to pay.
This property should hold regardless of the pricing approach chosen in (5d) (buyer-centric or seller-centric).
On the buyer side, reporting the truthful willingness to pay (WTP) is operationally optimal. If the analyst
understates their WTP, they may fail to acquire labels that are quite informative, thereby reducing overall
model performance. Conversely, overstating the WTP may result in purchasing labels whose value does not
justify the payment, making the purchase strictly suboptimal.
On the seller side, changing the WTS cannot increase the seller’s expected payoff. This is because,
under both pricing mechanisms, a label must first pass the market’s selection criterion in (5c) before it
can be purchased. Increasing the WTS 𝜂𝑗always makes it harder for the label to satisfy this criterion,
and therefore directly lowers the probability of being selected. Decreasing the WTS does not increase the
payment received. Hence, even before considering the pricing rule, manipulating the WTS cannot improve
expected revenue because it interferes with the basic eligibility to be purchased. Even if one imagines
removing the selection criterion entirely, increasing the WTS still does not benefit the seller. In principle, a
seller might try to raise the WTS up to the buyer’s budget threshold 𝐵, since this is the maximum amount that
the buyer could ever pay. However, the seller does not know the buyer’s budget: it is internal information
available only to the analyst. Therefore, in both BC and SC, manipulating the WTS cannot improve the
seller’s expected payoff. Another consideration is on data quality - if the data provided is not true, then the
probability of the modified data being purchased is lower than the probability of purchasing the true data,
therefore the expected utility is lower as well.
For these reasons, and within the scope of our simplified, non-strategic market structure, truthful revela-
tion is operationally advantageous for both buyers and sellers.
(iv) Individual Rationality
Individual rationality is satisfied if all sellers entering the market are not in a potential loss-making position.
In view of the definition of our pricing approaches, constraints (5c) and (5d) ensure that the payment will
only be such that 𝑝𝑗≥𝜂𝑗. On the analyst side, while labels are only purchased if they lead to a loss reduction,
the constraint (5e) ensures that they achieve a desirable level of loss reduction within the budget constraint.
(v) Zero-Element.
8

The zero-element property requires that no transaction should occur when a seller does not provide a data
point or provides a data point with no value (i.e., 𝑙𝑗= 0). In the relaxed optimisation problem (5), this
property holds automatically: if 𝑙𝑗= 0, the point neither contributes to the model-improvement requirement
nor lowers the analyst’s total cost. Hence the optimal solution sets 𝑧𝑗= 0, and the corresponding payment
satisfies
𝑧𝑗𝑝𝑗= 0,
∀𝑗: 𝑙𝑗= 0.
(7)
In contrast, the behaviour differs once pricing rules are applied in the algorithms. Under buyer-centric
(BC) pricing, the payment rule 𝑝𝑗= 𝜙𝑙𝑗ensures 𝑝𝑗= 0 whenever 𝑙𝑗= 0, so the zero-element condition is
operationally true. However, in seller-centric (SC) pricing, a label must be acquired before its improvement
can be evaluated, and the price 𝑝𝑗= 𝜂𝑗applies to any acquired label irrespective of 𝑙𝑗. Thus, while the
zero-element property holds cleanly at the level of the relaxed optimisation problem, it cannot be enforced
at the payment level under SC pricing. Later, in Section 3.3 and 4, we show how active learning strategies
reduce the frequency with which non-improving points are queried in practice, thereby mitigating the impact
of this limitation under SC pricing.

Methodology
Solving (5) is not tractable in practice, in view of the combinatorial nature of the optimisation problem. In
contrast, here, we introduce an active learning framework that allows one to operationalize data purchasing
under budget constraints. It should be seen as a greedy approach to solving the original problem. The
existing literature on active learning often overlooks transactional frictions and assumes access to all labels
without cost (or at the same cost). Our framework fills this methodological gap by explicitly modelling
the acquisition of labels as a market interaction, where data is traded between sellers and a data analyst
constrained by a budget and incentivized by model performance gains. This section proceeds by describing
the modelling structure, evaluation metrics, and the specific learning strategies deployed.
3.1
Modelling framework
To simulate this process, we model a dynamic market environment, visualized in Figure 2, where a data
analyst begins with a small labelled dataset 𝐷L and a large pool of unlabelled data 𝐷U while data providers
possess missing labels 𝐷ML.
At each iteration, the analyst computes model performance based on the
current labelled data 𝐷L and evaluates whether the acquisition of an additional data point is expected to
reduce the loss 𝑙of the model. A purchase decision is made only if the marginal loss reduction 𝑙𝑗, achieved
by purchasing a data point 𝑦𝑗∈𝐷ML, justifies its cost, subject to a budget constraint 𝐵. Data points are
integrated into the model only if their contribution is positive and cost-effective, and this process continues
until the budget is exhausted or a predefined performance threshold 𝛼is met.
3.2
Quality metrics
3.2.1
Focus on estimation quality
In many applications, accurate parameter estimation is essential for interpreting relationships between input
features and target outcomes. In fields such as real estate or pharmaceuticals, regression coefficients serve as
interpretable measures—indicating, for example, how location or size affects property prices, or how dosage
influences drug efficacy. In such contexts, the focus is on in-sample model fit and the stability of estimated
parameters.
We adopt the linear regression model as the foundation.

where 𝑌𝑘is the response variable, x𝑘is the vector of input features for sample 𝑘, 𝛽is the coefficient vector,
and 𝜖𝑘denote the error term. Under standard assumptions, the variance of the estimated parameters is:
Var[𝛽] = (X⊤X)−1 𝜎2
𝑌
(9)
which highlights the role of data geometry—via the information matrix X⊤X—in determining estimation
precision. In the above, 𝜎2
𝑌is the variance of the response variable 𝑌. Lower parameter variance implies
greater model stability and more reliable interpretation.
3.2.2
Focus on predictive ability
In forecasting-oriented domains such as energy demand prediction or financial modelling, model perfor-
mance is primarily assessed by its ability to generalize to unseen data. Rather than focusing on parameter
interpretability, these applications prioritize minimizing out-of-sample prediction error. To quantify this, the
mean squared error (MSE) is employed as the primary evaluation metric.
In this study, we use a validation-based evaluation approach.
The model is trained on an initially
labelled dataset, and candidate data points are acquired from an unlabelled pool using various active learning
strategies. Model performance is evaluated on a separate, held-out validation set that simulates future or
independent data. This setup reflects practical decision-making scenarios, in which the effectiveness of data
acquisition must be measured against a real-world prediction task.
Formally, given a linear regression model as defined in (8), the predictions ˆ𝑌𝑘are evaluated using:
𝐿= 1
𝑁
𝑁
∑︁
𝑘=1
(𝑌𝑘−ˆ𝑌𝑘)2,
(10)
i.e., with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) criterion, where 𝑌𝑘and ˆ𝑌𝑘denote the true and predicted values in
the validation set (with 𝑁forecast-observation pairs). The goal of each acquisition strategy is to improve the
model performance in this validation set while respecting budget constraints.
3.3
Data purchase strategies
The data purchase problem addressed in this paper is inherently constrained by budget and governed by
heterogeneous pricing. Active learning, a framework designed to select the most informative data point under
10

label scarcity, provides a principled foundation for addressing such challenges [Zheng and Padmanabhan,
2006, 2002]. In particular, active learning allows the analyst to determine which data points should be
acquired to maximize model improvement while minimizing redundant or uninformative acquisitions. Active
learning strategies are typically divided into two families: optimization-based and heuristic-based approaches
[Cohn et al., 1996, Tong, 2001, Settles, 2011]. Optimization-based methods rely on objective functions that
formalize notions of informativeness, such as uncertainty reduction or expected loss. In contrast, heuristic-
based approaches draw on approximations or model ensembles to identify uncertain points. In our study,
we focus on one strategy from each category: variance-based active learning (VBAL), rooted in optimal
experimental design, and Query-by-Committee active learning (QBCAL), a heuristic method based on
committee disagreement. As a benchmark, we include a random sampling corrected (RSC) strategy.
3.3.1
Variance-Based Active Learning (VBAL)
Variance-based active learning (VBAL) is based in Optimal Experimental Design (OED), which provides
criteria for selecting data points that most effectively reduce model uncertainty in regression tasks [Lu et al.,
2024, Atkinson, 1996, Atkinson and Bailey, 2001, Atkinson et al., 2007]. A central quantity in OED is
the information matrix X⊤X, derived from the feature X of the labelled dataset [Zheng and Padmanabhan,
2006]. Several classical criteria operate on this matrix to guide selection: D-optimality seeks to minimize
the volume of the confidence ellipsoid around the regression coefficients by maximizing det(X⊤X); The
A-optimality minimizes the average variance of the coefficient estimates by minimizing tr(X⊤X)−1; and
the G-optimality focuses on predictive reliability, aiming to minimize the maximum prediction variance in
the design space. While D and A-optimality optimize parameter estimation globally, G-optimality is more
aligned with our goal: ensuring that predictions are uniformly reliable across all regions of the input space.
In formal terms, G-optimality minimizes the worst-case prediction variance, defined as
min
X max
𝑥∈X 𝑥⊤(X⊤X)−1𝑥
(11)
where X ∈R𝑛×𝑝stacks the currently labelled covariates as rows; X ⊂R𝑝is the candidate design space; and
𝑥∈X is a column vector. We assume X has full column rank so that X⊤X is invertible; when this matrix is
ill-conditioned early in the process, we replace (X⊤X)−1 with (X⊤X + 𝜆𝐼)−1 for a small 𝜆> 0.
However, in our setting, instead of optimizing the entire design, we operate in a sequential and budget-
constrained environment where data is acquired one point at a time. Therefore, we adopt a greedy ap-
proximation of G-optimality by selecting, at each step, the candidate data point with the highest unscaled
prediction variance (UPV):
𝑥∗= arg max
𝑥∈𝐷U 𝑥⊤(X⊤X)−1𝑥
(12)
This UPV score reflects the epistemic uncertainty of the model on each candidate and acts as a local
pointwise surrogate for G-optimality. Though it does not yield a globally optimal design, it is well-suited
for iterative acquisition under limited budget and incomplete information.
In both active-learning strategies and the RSC baseline, pricing follows an ex-post mechanism. The
analyst first proposes to purchase a candidate point and, after acquiring its label, temporarily augments the
model with this labelled point for evaluation purposes. This allows her to compute the realised improvement
𝑙𝑗. Only after observing 𝑙𝑗is the price 𝑝𝑗determined—e.g., via constraint (5d) under the buyer-centric
scheme. Thus, she proposes a purchase, inspects the actual contribution of the point, and then pays a price
directly tied to its realised value. This ex-post pricing structure is standard in many practical settings (e.g.,
value-based pricing, performance-contingent payments) and naturally integrates into our label purchase
problem here. Eventually, the detailed approach to implementing VBAL is described in Algorithm 1.

3.3.2
Query-by-Committee-Based Active Learning (QBCAL)
In addition to VBAL, we employ Query-by-Committee-based active learning (QBCAL) as a robust alternative
for data acquisition under uncertainty. QBCAL is particularly well-suited to settings in which a single model
may provide unreliable or overconfident uncertainty estimates, especially in the presence of sparse labelled
data, model misspecification, or complex, multimodal feature spaces. By leveraging model disagreement as
a proxy for epistemic uncertainty, QBCAL enables the identification of data points where the current labelled
set provides insufficient or inconsistent information.
Classical QBCAL approaches in classification typically fall into two categories: vote entropy [Freund
et al., 1997, Argamon-Engelson and Dagan, 1999], which quantifies disagreement among classifiers by
evaluating the entropy of predicted labels, and margin confidence [Abe and Mamitsuka, 1998, Settles, 2011],
which prioritizes points with the smallest difference between the most probable class labels. Although
effective in classification tasks, these strategies are not directly applicable in regression settings where the
output is continuous rather than categorical.
To adapt QBCAL to our regression-based context, we adopt a variance-based formulation that directly
measures prediction dispersion. At each iteration, a model committee 𝑀= {𝑀1, 𝑀2, . . . , 𝑀𝑚} is trained
12

using bootstrap replicates of the current labelled dataset 𝐷L. For each candidate point 𝑥𝑗∈𝐷U, the predictive
uncertainty is quantified by the variance of the committee output:
Var( ˆ𝑦(𝑥𝑗)) = 1
𝑀
𝑀
∑︁
𝑚=1
  ˆ𝑦𝑚(𝑥𝑗) −¯ˆ𝑦(𝑥𝑗)2
(13)
where ˆ𝑦𝑚(𝑥𝑗) is the prediction of the model 𝑀𝑚and ¯ˆ𝑦(𝑥𝑗) is the mean prediction of all members of
the committee. The candidate with the highest predictive variance is selected as the most informative. As
in VBAL, the analyst estimates the expected loss reduction 𝑙𝑗and evaluates whether the point satisfies the
cost-efficiency constraint given in (5c). If the expected benefit is positive and the acquisition cost is within
budgetary limits, the point is added to the labelled dataset, the model is updated, and the budget is adjusted.
This process continues until the performance threshold 𝛼is achieved or the available budget 𝐵is fully
consumed. The detailed version of QBCAL is in Algorithm 2.

Random Sampling Corrected (RSC) strategy
The Random Sampling Corrected (RSC) strategy, formally detailed in Algorithm 3, serves as a baseline in
our analysis. It allows us to evaluate the benefits of more sophisticated active learning strategies against
a simple, non-informed approach that still incorporates basic cost awareness.
The method is based on
traditional random sampling, but is corrected to avoid unproductive data acquisitions. At each iteration, the
data analyst randomly selects a data point from the pool of unlabelled data with missing labels, denoted 𝐷ML.
This selected data point is evaluated by estimating the potential reduction in model loss 𝑙𝑗that would result
from incorporating it into the labelled dataset 𝐷L. If this estimated loss reduction is positive—i.e., if the data
point is expected to improve the model, and the cost-effectiveness of this data point satisfies the constraint
given in (5c), then the data point is purchased. Upon purchase, the data point is removed from 𝐷ML, added
13

to 𝐷L, and the model is retrained with the augmented dataset. The total cost 𝑐is updated by adding the price
of the newly acquired data point. This process repeats until the budget is exhausted or the model reaches the
desired performance level. While RSC does not leverage structure in the feature space or model uncertainty,
it avoids purchasing uninformative or harmful data points, making it a reasonable benchmark for evaluating
active learning methods.

Real-world applications
Our proposed active learning markets can be applied to broad scenarios, either to improve estimation quality,
or to improve predictive ability. Therefore, here we focus on the real estate data set and the energy building
data set, respectively. Under each dataset, we use active learning as our data purchase strategy to show how
our strategy can (i) improve cost-efficiency in decision making, (ii) benefit both the analyst and the sellers,
and (iii) ensure robustness in real-world applications.
4.1
Focus on estimation quality
4.1.1
Dataset and case-study
We used a public real estate data set from Sindian District, New Taipei City [Yeh, 2021], containing key
transaction features (date, age, MRT distance, convenience stores) and unit-area price. A linear regression
model is used to explain the variation in prices.
4.1.2
What are the effects of applying active learning?
We set the WTP at 𝜙= 1200 (£/Δ), budget at 𝐵= £15, and a target improvement of 20%. To introduce
controlled heterogeneity on the seller side, the WTS 𝜂𝑗is generated synthetically from the “distance to MRT”
14

feature:
𝜂𝑗= 𝑑0 + 𝑑1
 
1 −
𝑋3 𝑗−𝑋3
𝑋3 −𝑋3
!
,
with 𝑑0 = 0.1, 𝑑1 = 0.5, and [𝑋3, 𝑋3] the observed range. This serves only to induce heterogeneous seller
costs (e.g., privacy, effort, reluctance) in a controlled manner; it does not imply that property characteristics
determine economic WTS. Prices follow (5d), with all other parameters identical in BC and SC. Under BC
(Figure 3), VBAL and QBCAL reach higher improvement (21.17%, 21.23%) than RSC (20.01%) at similar
cost (≈10). Under SC (Figure 4), they again improve faster while costing far less (£4.90–£4.96 vs £10.34).
A summary is provided in Table 1.
Statistical validation.
To confirm that the observed average cost differences are statistically significant,
we applied the non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The test compared each active learning method
(VBAL and QBCAL) with the random sampling corrected (RSC) baseline across 50 paired runs under both
pricing schemes. Table 2 reports the two-sided 𝑝-values and median cost differences. All comparisons
yield 𝑝< 0.05, indicating significant differences in cost performance. Under buyer-centric (BC) pricing,
VBAL and QBCAL show notably lower median average costs than RSC (−16.409 and −16.499), while under
seller-centric (SC) pricing, both also achieve smaller but consistent reductions (−0.059 and −0.027). These
results confirm that the cost-efficiency advantages of the proposed methods are statistically robust rather than
due to random variation.

Does active learning improve cost-efficiency for analysts?
Beyond the averages reported in Table 1, a more revealing picture arises when we track how cost efficiency
evolves from the analyst’s perspective. Figure 5 illustrates the cumulative average of the cost-efficiency ratio,
Δ𝑣/Δ𝑐, achieved up to the data points purchased, where Δ𝑣represents the reduction in posterior variance

reduction in variance per unit cost. As shown in this figure, VBAL and QBCAL consistently outperform the
baseline RSC method. Note that we report dynamics only for SC because, under constraints (5c)–(5d) in the
optimization problem (5), the cost-efficiency ratio in BC is fixed at 1/𝜙and thus omitted.

Do pricing approaches affect sellers?
To assess how pricing schemes influence sellers’ revenue, we examine the set of sellers selected under the
BC and SC approaches, ranking them in descending order by their BC revenue. Figure 6 reports the revenue
differences between the two schemes. The x-axis represents the number of sellers rather than specific IDs;
the two adjacent bars correspond to the same seller under BC and SC. The results show that data prices
in BC are consistently higher than in SC. In the buyer-centric scheme, the analyst allocates her budget to

maximize improvement and is willing to pay more for highly informative labels, resulting in substantially
higher revenue for the most valuable sellers. In contrast, the seller-centric scheme spreads the budget more
evenly, producing smaller revenue differences between sellers. In general, BC rewards high-value sellers
more strongly by highlighting informativeness, while SC produces a more balanced distribution of revenue
across the market.

Is Our Active Learning Strategy Robust?
For all robustness experiments in this section, we evaluate the algorithms using the number of effectively
purchased data points — the subset of acquired points that were actually incorporated into the model and
contributed to improvement. This distinguishes true learning progress from mere expenditure. To assess
robustness, we performed two Monte Carlo–based analyses: the first examined how random data perturbations
affect performance, and the second explored the sensitivity to key model and economic parameters.

A Monte Carlo simulation with 1,000 replications was conducted by repeatedly resam-
pling subsets of the original data, with a model-improvement threshold fixed at 20%. Figures 7 and 8 show
the resulting distributions of effectively purchased data points (i.e., data points used to improve the model)
for buyer-centric (BC) and seller-centric (SC) pricing schemes. VBAL and QBCAL exhibit concentrated
frequency distributions (Figures 7a–b and 8a–b), indicating stable behaviour across replications, while the
random baseline (RSC) produces flatter distributions (Figures 7c and 8c), reflecting higher variability and
lower robustness.

Parameter Sensitivity.
A second Monte Carlo analysis evaluated how key parameters affect performance
in the estimation-quality-focused setting. We varied (i) the WTP of the buyer (𝜙), (ii) the WTS scaling
coefficient of the seller (𝑑1), and (iii) the budget limit (𝐵), holding all other parameters at baseline (the
improvement threshold was raised to 90% to clarify WTP trends). Figures 9a–9f and Table 4 (Appendix)
show that VBAL and QBCAL maintain smooth, monotonic purchase patterns, whereas RSC exhibits irregular
fluctuations due to its non-adaptive design. As 𝑑1 increases, stricter acceptance reduces purchases, with
occasional local increases when the remaining budget allows high-value purchases. Overall, VBAL and
QBCAL acquire fewer but more informative samples than RSC, demonstrating stronger selectivity and cost
efficiency.

4.2
Focus on predictive ability
Although active learning in the estimation-quality-focused scenario shows promising results, it is equally
important to evaluate performance in a predictive-ability-focused setting, where the emphasis is on general-
ization.
4.2.1
Case study and dataset
We use the BDG2 dataset [Wang et al., 2022], which contains the hourly energy consumption of 1,636
buildings from 2016 to 2017.
For illustration, we consider an educational building (“Rachael”) as the
data analyst and identify its most similar building (“Madge”) via Euclidean distance in the feature space,
treating it as the data seller. Each observation includes the month, weekday, day, hour, holiday indicator,
air temperature, and energy consumption. We adopt a sliding-window approach using only the “value”
characteristic (hourly consumption) to construct lagged inputs: the consumption of the past seven days’
at 24-hour intervals (e.g. 𝑡−168, 𝑡−144, . . . , 𝑡−24), with the current hour’s consumption at time 𝑡as the
prediction target. Then a linear forecasting model is trained on these lagged features.
Label availability.
Although the BDG2 data set contains complete hourly labels, we simulate a market
environment in which labels 𝑌must be purchased at the time of use. This mimics realistic settings where
timely, cleaned, and query-ready data carry an access cost—even if such data may later become freely
available (as in IoT systems). In our batch-learning setup, labels become available only when purchased,
consistent with the market-based learning framework.
In this experiment, model-improvement threshold is set to 20% and the budget is 𝐵= £1200. The
analyst’s WTP is 𝜙= 50 (£/ΔMSE). As in Section 3.2.2, “Rachael” represents the analyst and “Madge” is
the seller. The WTS of the seller is set uniformly at 𝜂= 30 (£/label). The mechanism sensitivity constant is
set to 30 and scaled by the feature-normalisation factor 𝛾, giving an effective sensitivity of 30𝛾.
4.2.2
What are the effects of applying active learning?
Table 3 compares the performance of the proposed active learning strategies (VBAL and QBCAL) with the
random sampling corrected strategy (RSC). In the BC setting, VBAL and QBCAL achieve similar levels of
model improvement (∼17%) at lower average cost per data point (£12.81 and £7.68, respectively) relative to
RSC (£13.53). In the SC setting, the average cost per data point is identical between methods by design, so
performance differences arise solely from the selectivity of the strategies rather than from the pricing. The
trends in model improvement and accumulated cost closely mirror those in Section 4.1.2 and are omitted for
brevity. Statistical testing for BC is not repeated here as well. Under the seller-centric mechanism, costs are
fully determined by fixed willingness-to-sell (WTS) values, making statistical testing not applicable.

Does active learning improve cost-efficiency for analysts?
Similarly in Section 4.1.3, Figure 10 illustratestheaccumulativecost-efficiencymetric, denotedbyΔ𝑀𝑆𝐸/Δ𝑐,
as more data points are purchased. The VBAL and QBCAL strategies consistently achieve higher Δ𝑀𝑆𝐸/Δ𝑐
values than RSC, indicating greater model improvement per unit cost. This demonstrates that the active
learning-based approaches provide higher returns on labeling investment, particularly under limited budgets.

4.2.4
Do pricing approaches affect sellers?
Figure 11 highlights the differences in the revenue distributions for sellers under the BC and SC pricing
approaches. The BC approach results in a more concentrated revenue distribution compared to the SC
approach. This suggests that BC pricing prioritizes sellers whose data points deliver the greatest utility,
ensuring that compensation is more closely aligned with the quality and contribution of their data. In contrast,
the broader revenue distribution in the SC approach indicates a less targeted allocation of compensation,
potentially reducing incentives for sellers to offer high-utility data. Such findings highlight the effectiveness
of the BC approach in incentivizing high-quality sellers and fostering efficient data markets by concentrating
resources where they are most impactful.

4.2.5
Is our active learning strategy robust?
Data Variability
We ran 1,000 Monte Carlo iterations with a fixed 20% improvement target. Figures 12
and 13 report the distributions of the data points needed under BC and SC, respectively. VBAL and QBCAL
show narrow, stable distributions, indicating strong robustness to random data variation, while RSC exhibits
substantially wider spread.
Parameter Sensitivity
We examine robustness through two analyses: (i) one-at-a-time parameter vari-
ations (Figure 14) and (ii) a Monte Carlo study over 50 random splits (summary in Table 5, Appendix).
Figures 14a–14b show the effect of WTP: in BC, VBAL and QBCAL purchase more data as 𝜙increases up
to 50, then decline once the budget constraint (5e) binds; in SC, effective purchases decrease monotonically
with WTP, while RSC fluctuates due to its non-adaptive design. Figures 14c–14d vary the seller’s WTS
scale, and all methods buy fewer labels as the WTS increases. Figures 14e–14f vary budget limits (with
the improvement threshold raised to 90% to sharpen trends): more budget leads to more acquisitions, with
VBAL and QBCAL consistently requiring fewer points than RSC. In general, both VBAL and QBCAL
remain selective and cost-effective across all settings.

Conclusions and perspectives for future work
5.1
Conclusions
Active learning markets are introduced as a way to purchase labels using active learning approaches,
as motivated by real-world applications. The proposed framework addresses challenges prevalent across
various industrial sectors, including real estate and energy forecasting, which serve as the primary scenarios
in our analysis. Specifically, we employ two active learning approaches for cost-effective data acquisition:
variance-based active learning (VBAL) and Query-by-Committee active learning (QBCAL). Additionally,
we examine two distinct pricing mechanisms – buyer-centric (BC) and seller-centric (SC)—representing
extreme real-world conditions. Our analysis highlights the payment structure for data analysts and compares
revenue distributions among data sellers under the proposed active learning approaches and established
benchmarks.
This work yields three key findings.
First, both VBAL and QBCAL demonstrate significant cost-
efficiency in purchasing data when benchmarked against a random sampling approach. Second, under the
two extreme pricing conditions, active learning leads to a more concentrated revenue distribution. Third,
while both VBAL and QBCAL outperform random sampling in BC and SC pricing scenarios, practical
market designs may benefit from hybrid pricing mechanisms to better define data prices in active learning
markets.
Importantly, our study is the first to conceptualize the active learning market while building on prior
research into observation and feature markets. The methodologies employed—spanning machine learning,
active learning, and optimal experimental design (OED)—offer a rich foundation for future exploration.
5.2
Future works
Efficient data purchase is becoming crucial in our data-driven economies. Our proposed innovative active
learning market provides a strong foundation to address this significant problem by offering a trade-off be-
tween cost and efficiency. Building on this success, further advancements can enhance its applicability. First,
while current data is purchased in a batch setting, real-world data may arrive continuously as a stream, creating
opportunities to develop a real-time label market. Second, a valuable extension is to investigate the multiple-
buyer-multiple-seller settings which involve competition between sellers and buyers in a resource-constrained
environment. In such competitive environments, game-theoretic tools and combinatorial optimization meth-
ods (e.g., knapsack heuristics) may play a larger role, complementing active learning in analyzing pricing,
market dynamics, and efficiency. Additionally, a one-shot formulation of VBAL is also possible, even in
the single-buyer–multiple-seller case, where the budget is allocated in a single step. This connects naturally
to knapsack heuristics, but requires the strong assumption that the utilities (or priorities) of all labels are
known in advance. For this reason, we focus on iterative allocation, which better reflects adaptive practice,
while leaving one-shot variants as an interesting theoretical direction for future work. Third, the design of
the market for data and information requires careful reconsideration. Unlike traditional commodities, the
uniqueness of data lies in defining both willingness to pay and willingness to sell, as its value is highly
context-dependent. For data buyers, their WTP may depend on relevance of tasks, timeliness of sharing,
quality of data, among others. For data sellers, their WTS can be influenced by the cost of acquiring data (and
storing or sharing it), heterogeneous competition, or privacy constraints. Studying these interplay factors
will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how the data market should be structured. Through
modelling those dynamics, one can develop more rigorous pricing mechanisms that incorporate strategic
behaviour, and thus ensure a fair, efficient, and incentive-compatible data market in the real-world scenarios.
Fourth, while our empirical results are strong, we note that deriving formal performance or regret guarantees
is particular challenging in our setting. Classical theoretical results in active learning typically assume that
24

all labels have identical unit cost, while our market-based setting allows heterogeneous prices that depend on
sellers’ costs or preferences. This means that performance depends jointly on label informativeness and cost,
and utilities evolve adaptively as labels are acquired, making standard analyses inapplicable. Developing
theoretical guarantees in such heterogeneous-cost settings is therefore a challenging but important direction
for future research. Finally, while our framework currently focuses on linear regression and models linear
in parameters, extending it to non-convex models such as deep neural networks is an important direction.
Estimating label value in such settings is substantially more challenging due to non-convex optimization
landscapes, stochastic training procedures, and state dependence. Possible avenues include using influence
functions, gradient-based embeddings, or Bayesian uncertainty estimates to approximate label utilities.
A
Monte Carlo results
This appendix reports additional Monte Carlo simulation results that complement the main estimation
results presented in Sections 4.1.5 (Table 4) and 4.2.5 (Table 5).
For each configuration, we vary key
model parameters—namely willingness-to-pay (WTP) 𝜙, willingness-to-sell (WTS) scaling coefficient 𝜂, and
budget limit 𝐵—and report the mean and interquartile range of purchased data points across 50 independent
runs. These results illustrate the robustness of the proposed pricing schemes and their sensitivity to parameter
variations.
