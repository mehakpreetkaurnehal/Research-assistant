Abstract
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel in robotic manipulation but are constrained
by their heavy reliance on expert demonstrations, leading to demonstration bias and limiting
performance. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a vital post-training strategy to overcome
these limits, yet current VLA-RL methods, including group-based optimization approaches,
are crippled by severe reward sparsity. Relying on binary success indicators wastes valuable
information in failed trajectories, resulting in low training efficiency. To solve this, we
propose Self-Referential Policy Optimization (SRPO), a novel VLA-RL framework. SRPO
eliminates the need for external demonstrations or manual reward engineering by leveraging
the model’s own successful trajectories, generated within the current training batch, as
a self-reference. This allows us to assign a progress-wise reward to failed attempts. A
core innovation is the use of latent world representations to measure behavioral progress
robustly. Instead of relying on raw pixels or requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, we

utilize the compressed, transferable encodings from a world model’s latent space. These
representations naturally capture progress patterns across environments, enabling accurate,
generalized trajectory comparison. Empirical evaluations on the LIBERO benchmark
demonstrate SRPO’s efficiency and effectiveness. Starting from a supervised baseline with
48.9% success, SRPO achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 99.2% in just 200 RL
steps, representing a 103% relative improvement without any extra supervision. Furthermore,
SRPO shows substantial robustness, achieving a 167% performance improvement on the
LIBERO-Plus benchmark.

Introduction
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models (Zitkovich et al., 2023; Team et al., 2024; Kim et al., 2024; Black
et al.) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in robotic manipulation by leveraging large-scale pre-trained
vision-language models. However, existing VLA systems rely heavily on expert demonstrations and tend to
overfit small downstream datasets, resulting in a strong demonstration bias that prevents them from surpassing
human performance (Fei et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2025). To address such limitations, many recent studies
have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective post-training strategy that can substantially
improve VLA performance, both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (Guo et al., 2025b; Liu et al., 2025;
Lu et al., 2025). Among RL methods, group-based optimization approaches such as GRPO (Shao et al.,
2024) have become particularly attractive, providing a simple yet highly effective learning paradigm for VLA
fine-tuning (Li et al., 2025; Zang et al., 2025; Tan et al., 2025).
Despite the remarkable progress in GRPO, it still suffers from sparsity challenges in reward signals (Chan
et al., 2024; Mu et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2024). This issue becomes particularly pronounced in VLA domains,
as the computational cost of multi-turn trajectory rollouts is substantially higher and the inadequate utilization
of information from failed trajectories significantly reduces training efficiency. While recent work has explored
process supervision to provide denser feedback, these approaches typically depend on expert demonstrations
or hand-crafted task decompositions to define intermediate progress milestones (Lu et al., 2025; Chen et al.,
2025b), creating scalability limitations that contradict the goal of autonomous learning.
To address the reward sparsity challenge, we propose self-referential learning, where the model’s own
successful trajectories serve as reference standards to evaluate and guide failed attempts. While GRPO
leverages outcome-only rewards for advantage estimation, our approach utilizes the entire trajectory batch
more efficiently. This paradigm transforms the supervision problem from “how do we obtain expert labels” to
“how do we extract progress-wise reward from our own successes”.
A central challenge in this paradigm lies in quantitatively measuring the behavioral similarity between
successful and failed trajectories to assess progress towards task completion. Since trajectories are represented
solely by visual observations, we require a reward model capable of extracting global state information to
measure progress. While world models offer a natural approach for modeling such dynamics (Assran et al.,
2025; Ali et al., 2025), traditional pixel-level world models suffer from poor generalization across domains or
typically require extensive task-specific fine-tuning (Xiao et al., 2025). We address this limitation by leveraging
the latent representations learned by world models, which we find naturally capture transferable behavioral
progress patterns across different environments. These latent world representations enable robust trajectory
comparison without requiring precise environmental reconstruction or domain-specific training.
Building on these insights, we propose Self-Referential Policy Optimization (SRPO), which seamlessly
integrates self-referential learning into the RL training structure. During each training iteration, we identify
successful trajectories within the batch and use them as behavioral references through world model latent
representations, while failed trajectories receive progress-wise rewards based on their behavioral alignment
with successful patterns. We opt for trajectory-level rewards over fine-grained reward shaping as overly
detailed hand-crafted dense signals can lead the policy to converge toward suboptimal solutions (Sutton, 2019;
Levine, 2024).
Empirical evaluation on the LIBERO (Liu et al., 2023) benchmark demonstrates the transformative impact
of our approach. Starting from a supervised fine-tuned baseline with just one demonstration per task and a
48.9% success rate, SRPO reaches 99.2% success in merely 200 reinforcement learning steps, representing
103% relative improvement that establishes new state-of-the-art performance. Importantly, this RL improve-
ment requires no additional expert demonstrations or manual reward engineering. Our method also shows

SRPO: Self-Referential Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language-Action Models
substantial improvements in robustness on the LIBERO-Plus (Fei et al., 2025a) benchmark, with 167% perfor-
mance improvement. Our proposed reward demonstrates its effectiveness in both simulation and real-world
experiments.
Our contributions are threefold as follow:
1. We propose SRPO, a novel VLA reinforcement learning framework that mitigates reward sparsity by
using model-generated successful trajectories to provide progress-wise rewards for failed attempts,
eliminating reliance on expert demonstration or task-specific engineering.
2. We introduce a latent world representation-based progress-wise reward method that overcomes the
generalization limitations and domain-specific training requirements of traditional pixel-level world
models.
3. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
LIBERO benchmark and exhibits strong generalization capabilities on LIBERO-Plus, while elim-
inating the need for additional supervision during RL training, establishing a new paradigm for
autonomous VLA learning.

Vision-Language-Action Models
The remarkable success of models trained on vast internet-scale datasets has demonstrated the power of scaling
laws, motivating the field to increasingly focus on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for transferring
these capabilities to embodied agents (Zitkovich et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2024; 2025; Black et al.; Pertsch
et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025b). Due to the limited generalization and domain adaptability of supervised
post-training, the field is increasingly turning to Reinforcement Learning (RL) to encourage exploration and
enhance overall robustness (Lu et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025). These studies have explored
the distinct characteristics of RL compared to SFT, employing RL algorithms to train both autoregressive
(Tan et al., 2025) and diffusion-based VLAs (Chen et al., 2025a), while also developing several integrated
training-and-inference frameworks. However, these approaches often suffer from sparse reward signals, which
prevent effective utilization of information from failure trajectories and limit training efficiency. To address
this, we propose a novel VLA-RL framework that leverages dense, zero-shot transferable rewards to enable
highly efficient policy learning.
2.2
Reinforcement Learning
The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language Models (LLMs) has evolved significantly
(Jaech et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2025a; Guo et al., 2025a; Team et al., 2025; Comanici et al., 2025; Fei et al.,
2025b). RLHF (Bai et al., 2022) successfully aligned models with human preferences using algorithms
like PPO (Schulman et al., 2017). RLVR (Wen et al., 2025) replacing expensive human preferences with
automatically verifiable rewards. GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) bypasses the need for a learned reward model
by using programmatic rewards. Recent works have also attempted to enhance stability and efficiency in
optimization (Yu et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025a; Yang et al., 2025b). Since task success serves as a naturally
verifiable reward, numerous works in the VLA domain have attempted to optimize policies using GRPO with
binary (0/1) rewards (Li et al., 2025; Zang et al., 2025; Tan et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025), while facing the
challenge of sparse reward signals. As robotic trajectory rollouts are more time-consuming and resource-
intensive, some works have begun to construct rewards using hand-crafted or task-specific priors (Chen
et al., 2025b; Lu et al., 2025; Shu et al., 2025). However, such methods requiring expert demonstrations or
prior information are difficult to scale in online RL settings that encourage autonomous learning. To this
end, we introduce a self-referential approach leveraging task-agnostic latent world representation to provide
progress-wise rewards, thus fully utilizing failure trajectory information to enhance learning efficiency.

Figure 2: Overview of the SRPO method. During policy rollout, both successful and failed trajectories are
collected in the Rollout Reference Set. For each trajectory, we employ a world model pre-trained on large-scale
robotics video data (Assran et al., 2025) as an encoder to extract latent world representations. Behavioral
similarity is modeled as the L2 distance between trajectory embeddings in this space to yield progress-wise
rewards. These rewards are subsequently used for advantage estimation and policy optimization under KL
regularization.

Methods
3.1
Problem Formulation and Key Components
Given the current observation ot at time step t, and a goal description l, the agent takes an action at according
to a policy πθ(at|ot, l) parameterized by θ and conditioned on a goal description l. The agent then receives the
next observation ot+1 from the environment, so on and so forth, until finally receiving a terminal observation
oT. If the agent successfully completes the task specified by the goal description l, it receives a positive
reward; otherwise, it receives reward depending on how close it is to completing the task. The objective is to
learn a policy that maximizes the reward received over time for a variety of goals l and the initial state of the
environment z.
The observation function is defined as ot ←O(zt), where O is the observation function that maps the
environment state zt to the partial observation ot received by the agent.
Action generation is modeled by the policy function πθ(at|ot, l) which is the θ parameterized probability
distribution over actions given the current observation ot, goal description l.
The environment function zt+1 ∼E(·|zt, at) defines the stochastic transition from the current environment
state zt to the next environment state zt+1 given the action at taken by the agent.
Trajectory Rollout is the process of generating a sequence of observations and actions over time, starting from
an initial environment state z0. The trajectory {(z0, o0, a0, z1, o1, a1, . . . , zT, oT)} are generated by iteratively
applying these functions:
ot = O(zt),
at ∼πθ(·|ot, l),
zt+1 ∼E(·|zt, at)
(1)
Note that the state of the environment zt is not directly accessible to the agent; instead, the agent relies on the
observation ot derived from zt through the observation function O.
The Reward function R(z0:T, l) evaluates how well the state trajectory is performing in achieving the goal
specified by l. This reward is usually provided by the environment at the end of the episode, based on whether
the goal described by l has been achieved. However, these rewards could be provided sparsely as 0 and 1,
making it difficult for the agent to learn effective policies through traditional reinforcement learning methods.
To address this, we adapt a world model to shape rewards ˆR(o0:T, S) for the failed trajectories to provide more
informative feedback during training, as described in detail in Section 3.2.
3.2
World progress reward modeling
As have mentioned earlier, neither the states z0:T nor the reward function R(z0:T, l) are directly accessible to
the agent. There is only the sparse terminal reward signal provided at the end of each episode. We propose a
4

SRPO: Self-Referential Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language-Action Models
world model-based task-agnostic reward shaping mechanism to provide progress-wise signals for unsuccessful
rollout trajectories. The reward can be shaped as ˆR(o0:T, S), where S =
n
o(i)
0:T; R(z(i)
0:T, l) = 1, ∀i
o
is the
observation set of successful trajectories.
First, we encode the observations of the unsuccessful trajectory and the successful reference trajectories, with
a world-model encoder W,
hi = W(o(i)
0:T).
(2)
We then cluster the representations of the successful trajectories using the DBSCAN algorithm (Ester et al.,
1996) to obtain a set of representative centers. The distance to the closest center representation is then
calculated; a smaller distance indicates a larger reward.
C = DBSCAN(S)
(3)
di = min(
n
∥hi −hj∥2; hj ∈C
o
)
(4)
Finally, the reward is calculated with
gi =
(
1.0
for succes trajectory
ϕ( di−¯d
σd )
for failed trajectory ,
(5)
where ϕ(·) is an activation function transforming the output to the range (0, 1), and ¯d and σd are the mean and
standard deviation, respectively, of the calculated distance for all failed trajectories.
3.3
Self-Referential Policy Optimization
We introduce Self-Referential Policy Optimization (SRPO), a novel policy optimization framework for VLA
models that leverages latent world representations to enable self-referential advantage estimation on trajec-
tory level.
Following GRPO, the probability ratio, advantage and regularization terms are
ri,t(θ) =
πθ(a(i)
t |o(i)
t , l)
πθold(a(i)
t |o(i)
t , l)
,
ˆAi = gi −µg
σg
,
ω(θ) = βDKL

πθ ∥πre f

.
(6)
The clipped surrogate objective is
LCLIP
t,i
(θ) = min(ri,t(θ) ˆAi, clip(ri,t(θ), 1 −ϵ, 1 + ϵ) ˆAi)
(7)
The overall SRPO objective, which we aim to maximize, is given by the expectation of the LCLIP(θ) function.
This expectation is computed over time steps t and sample IDs i within the current training group, with an
additional regularization term applied to the parameters θ.
LSRPO(θ) = Et,iLCLIP
t,i
(θ) + ω(θ),
(8)
for simplicity, the expectation over different tasks l and initial state z0 have been omitted. The group statistics
are derived from world progress rewards as follows:
µ ˆR = 1
M
M
∑
j=1
ˆRj, σ ˆR =
v
u
u
t 1
M
M
∑
j=1
( ˆRj −µ ˆR)2 + ϵ.
(9)
This self-referential approach enables the policy to learn from relative performance within trajectory groups,
where rewards ˆRj are computed through our world progress reward model rather than traditional task-specific
rewards. The KL divergence DKL(πθ ∥πref) term maintains policy stability.

Experiments
Our experimental design addresses several fundamental research questions: RQ1: Can SRPO achieve state-
of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks? RQ2: Does the method possess strong generalization
capabilities to adapt to unseen task scenarios? RQ3: Can the latent world modeling-based reward mechanism
accurately assess task progress, and does it outperform both pixel-level approaches and conventional video
encoding methods? RQ4: Can SRPO improve training efficiency? RQ5: Can SRPO motivate novel trajectory
exploration? RQ6: Whether the reward shaping method can successfully transfer to real-world robotic systems
without requiring domain-specific expert demonstrations?
4.1
Experimental Setup
Main experiments are conducted on the LIBERO (Liu et al., 2023) benchmark, specifically on Goal, Spatial,
Object and Long suites, each of which contains 10 tasks for evaluating a distinct model capability. To evaluate
generalization robustness, we employ the LIBERO-Plus (Fei et al., 2025a) benchmark that introduces seven
dimensions of perturbations.

Models. For simulation experiments, we utilize a modified version of OpenVLA enhanced with action
chunking and parallel decoding, which we refer to as OpenVLA* in the following sections. OpenVLA*-One
refers to base model with one-traj-per-task SFT, while OpenVLA*-Full refers to full-shot SFT. More details
can be found in Appendix G.1.
Baseline Methods. Our baseline selection includes: SimpleVLA-RL (Li et al., 2025), RIPT-VLA (Tan
et al., 2025) and RLinf (Zang et al., 2025) trained with GRPO, VLA-RL (Lu et al., 2025) with PPO, GRAPE
(Zhang et al., 2024) with trajectory-wise DPO, TGRPO (Chen et al., 2025b) with task-specific progress
reward, World-Env (Xiao et al., 2025) utilizing world model as simulator. We also provide some imitation
learning methods (Kim et al., 2024; Pertsch et al., 2025; Black et al.; Shukor et al., 2025; Cen et al., 2025;
Hung et al., 2025; Zhao et al., 2025; Bu et al., 2025; Zheng et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2025; Huang et al., 2025;
Bjorck et al., 2025; Bhat et al., 2025; Kim et al., 2025) as reference, although they have different information
inputs or pre-training data.
Implementation Details. In the scope of this work, we consider the observation ot to be the third view image,
and the l to be a language description of the goal. The environment is a physics simulator that takes in the
current state zt (including object positions, velocities, etc.) and the action at (e.g., end-effector commands) to
produce the next state zt+1. The architecture of our policy is based on a pre-trained Visual-Language-Action
model, which integrates visual inputs and language descriptions to inform the agent’s actions.
We leverage SiiRL (Wang et al., 2025c) to develop our training framework. Our pipeline begins with supervised
fine-tuning using a single demonstration per task from the official checkpoint, followed by our SRPO method
for online reinforcement learning post-training. To obtain shared latent world representations, we employ a
large-scale video-pretrained latent world model, V-JEPA 2 (Assran et al., 2025). Training details and compute
reports are provided in the Appendix F.

Main Results
Main results are summarized in Table 1, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in terms of the overall average success rate across all four suites. The key findings are as follows:
(1) Effectiveness of Online Post-Training: While the initial one-shot SFT baseline shows modest performance,
SRPO significantly improves upon it, validating the efficacy of our online post-training paradigm in enhancing
policy performance through environment interaction.
(2) Superiority in Reward Design: Our method outperforms RL-based methods like SimpleVLA-RL and
RLinf, which rely on sparse outcome rewards, highlighting the importance of process rewards that provide
denser supervisory signals. Furthermore, it surpasses approaches using manually designed process rewards
like TGRPO and demonstrates that self-reference-based rewards, derived from pre-trained world models, offer
a more effective learning signal than task-specific alternatives that require heuristic stage partitioning and
reward tuning.
(3) SOTA Performance with Limited Inputs: Despite using only third-person visual observations and
language instructions as input, our method outperforms several baselines that utilize additional modalities such
as multiple camera views, proprioception (Black et al.; Pertsch et al., 2025; Shukor et al., 2025; Kim et al.,
2025) and 3D data (Bhat et al., 2025). This demonstrates that SRPO can achieve state-of-the-art performance
relying solely on visual inputs, highlighting its effectiveness and practical applicability.
4.3
Generalization Performance
To assess SRPO’s generalization, we validate two key aspects: (1) whether SRPO training in LIBERO
environments improves generalization over SFT, and (2) whether SRPO is more robust to perturbations than
training on the pre-collected LIBERO-Plus dataset. The following key findings are summarized from Table 2:
(1) SRPO Overcomes the Diversity Limitation of One-Shot SFT. While the one-shot SFT baseline exhibits
weak generalization due to limited trajectory diversity, SRPO post-training enables it to surpass even the
full-shot SFT policy. This is attributed to SRPO’s online interaction, which explores a broader range of
trajectories than those contained in the static full-shot dataset. A detailed analysis of this trajectory diversity
advantage is provided in Section 5.3.
(2) SRPO also Surpasses Full-Shot SFT in Perturbed Data Settings. When trained in perturbed envi-
ronments, our method not only exceeds the performance of the full-shot SFT baseline but also outperforms
OpenVLA-OFT (utilizes additional wrist image and proprioception) trained with full-shot SFT. This result
underscores that the trajectory diversity afforded by SRPO plays a major role in improving generalization,
compensating for and exceeding the advantage of more complex input modalities.

Analysis
5.1
Can Latent World Representation Improve Reward Shaping?
We compare our approach against two alternative reward formulations: (1) pixel-level progress reward (Wen
et al., 2025), which computes similarity based on pixel-wise features, and (2) ImageBind-based progress
reward, derived from the general-purpose vision embeddings model ImageBind (Girdhar et al., 2023).

achieved a better level than the baseline in all 5 indicators.

Qualitative Visualization. We evaluate our
progress reward approach on several tasks (e.g.,
placing a cup in a microwave, tidying a desk).
As shown in Figure 3, our method produces
smoother, more monotonic progress curves that
better reflect task structure, especially for long-
horizon tasks with repeated sub-tasks. In con-
trast, pixel-level and ImageBind-based methods
generate fluctuating, non-monotonic progress
signals. This improvement comes from embedding entire trajectories into a latent space that captures physical
regularities, allowing for more accurate estimation of task progress. Further reward curves and success/failure
trajectory examples are provided in Appendix B.

Our SRPO reward (a,d) provides monotonic and physically plausible progress estimation. Pixel-level rewards
(b,e) show sensitivity to perceptual changes, while ImageBind rewards (c,f) exhibit erratic trends from jerky
motions.
Quantitative Comparison. We carefully selected 700 success trajectories progressing steadily towards the
goal and 300 failure trajectories from multiple tasks in both simulation and real-world environments. We
establish five metrics for evaluating progress rewards: Spearman Correlation (SC) and Monotonicity (Mono)
are computed exclusively on success trajectories to measure the positive correlation with frame numbers and
the trajectory’s monotonicity, respectively; Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), JS Divergence (JS), and
Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) are statistical measures that quantify the distinguishability between
success and failure trajectories. For all five metrics, a higher value indicates better performance. As shown
in Table 3, our method provides more reasonable progress rewards for intermediate failure states and better
distinguishes between success and failure trajectories, thereby more effectively utilizing the failure trajectories.
The detailed formulations of our bench are provided in Appendix A.

Training Effectiveness. As shown in Figure 4, the
pixel-level method exhibits notably slow convergence,
suggesting that its reward signal provides insufficient
guidance for effective policy optimization. While Im-
ageBind demonstrates faster initial learning compared
to the pixel-level approach, its performance plateaus
around 85% without further improvement, indicating
that the suboptimal progress estimation hinders the
model’s ability to extract useful information from fail-
ure trajectories, ultimately causing training stagnation.
We argue that the pixel-level method is fundamen-
tally limited because it relies solely on the final frame
and exhibits sensitivity to minor pixel changes, and
a general visual model like ImageBind lacks the ca-
pability of understanding robotics-relevant physical
concepts. Our experimental results confirm that effec-
tive progress estimation for VLAs requires rewards
grounded in world progress rather than simple perceptual similarity.
5.2
Can SRPO Improve Training Efficiency?
Our results across the four suites are obtained using 79 steps (Spatial), 59 steps (Object), 103 steps (Goal), and
219 steps (Long), demonstrating significant advantages over SFT which requires tens of thousands of steps.
Meanwhile, we compare the efficiency differences between SRPO and GRPO, as shown in Figure 5. The
results clearly indicate that SRPO achieves a steeper efficiency slope than GRPO, especially for long-horizon

tasks. Unlike GRPO, which essentially discards unsuccessful episodes, our self-referential framework can
extract valuable learning signals from near-successful trajectories by recognizing and rewarding the productive
segments within them, thereby guiding the policy more efficiently towards the final goal.

Can SRPO Motivate Novel Trajectory Exploration?

(b)   One-shot SFT + SRPO
Figure 6: Action space comparison of end-effector trajectories between (a) full-shot supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) and (b) SRPO online reinforcement learning (RL) policies.
A fundamental limitation of imitation learning is its inherent constraint to the state-action distribution present
in the demonstration data. To quantitatively assess whether SRPO enables the policy to transcend these
limitations and explore beyond the demonstrator’s domain, we analyze the diversity of actions generated by
the policy in LIBERO-Spatial task suite. We performed rollouts on this suite using both the full-shot SFT
weights and the RL fine-tuned weights, executing 10 trajectory episodes per task, with end-effector positions
utilized as actions, which is visualize in Figure 6.
The results demonstrate that the online RL-trained policy exhibits two key advantages over the SFT baseline in
terms of action distribution: (1) it explores previously unreachable regions; and (2) it generates more dispersed
trajectories, indicating the model’s propensity for spatial exploration rather than merely fitting to specific
demonstration paths.

across three tasks (from left to right): put the bowl
on top of the cabinet, put the yellow and white mug in
the microwave and close it, and put both the alphabet
soup and the cream cheese box in the basket.
Furthermore, as illustrated in Figure 7, even when the
policy is initially exposed to only a single success-
ful demonstration trajectory, the subsequent online
RL fine-tuning enables it to discover novel strate-
gies beyond the provided example. This exploration
is evident not only in the diversity of spatial paths
taken to approach the object but also in the variety
of grasping positions it discovers.
This finding underscores a key strength of our
method: the ability to autonomously acquire and
leverage novel knowledge, in terms of both motor
skills and affordance understanding, that was not
present in the original, limited demonstration data,
thereby significantly enhancing the policy’s robust-
ness and generalization.

Figure 8: Real-world task success rates comparing su-
pervised fine-tuning (SFT) baselines against our offline
RL approach. Our method consistently improves per-
formance across both diffusion-based (π0) and autore-
gressive (π0-FAST) VLA policies.
In this section, we investigate whether our proposed
latent world progress rewarding method can effec-
tively generalize to real-world robotic tasks. To this
end, we conduct experiments with offline RL ap-
proach on five real-world manipulation tasks per-
formed on an X-ARM 7 robot: Put apple into the
plate, Put pear into the plate, Folding towels, Clean-
ing whiteboard and Select Poker.
For each task, we compare two state-of-the-art vision-
language-action (VLA) policy backbones: π0 (a
diffusion-based VLA model) and π0-FAST (an au-
toregressive VLA enhanced with frequency-space
tokenization). Both models are compared against
standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) baselines.
Both the diffusion-based π0 and autoregressive π0-
FAST models demonstrate substantial performance
improvements when enhanced with our reward shap-
ing method, with average gains of +66.8% and
+86.7%, respectively. The most significant improve-
ments are observed on tasks involving object place-
ment and manipulation, underscoring the method’s
efficacy in adapting to perceptual variations. These consistent and substantial improvements across diverse
tasks and policy architectures confirm that progress-aware reward modeling effectively transfers to real-
world robotic manipulation, enabling more efficient policy optimization through better credit assignment and
progression-aware weighting.

Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce Self-Referential Policy Optimization (SRPO), a novel VLA reinforcement learning
approach leveraging task-agnostic latent world representation to provide progress-wise reward. By using self-
referential learning, we eliminate reliance on expert demonstration or task-specific engineering, and develop
an efficient VLA RL framework that can fully utilize the information provided by the failure trajectories,
achieving significant improvements in both performance and efficiency compared to the existing methods.
Further analysis demonstrates that our method improves reward shaping, motivates novel trajectory exploration,
and the world progress reward modeling can be effectively applied to real-world robotic tasks. This work
establishes a novel paradigm for efficient VLA reinforcement learning by demonstrating that pre-trained world
model latent representations provide a powerful, generic substrate for progress assessment.

SRPO: Self-Referential Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language-Action Models
A
Progress Reward Benchmark
Based on the carefully curated multi-task dataset of 700 human-annotated successful trajectories and 300
failure trajectories across diverse task domains, we propose a practical evaluation framework to assess the
quality of progress reward functions. All successful trajectories are manually selected to exhibit approximately
linear growth characteristics, meaning they demonstrate consistent forward progression without significant
regressions or backtracking (e.g., no instances of dropping objects and having to retrieve them). To better
test the model’s generalization performance, the selected trajectories contain various perturbations including
camera viewpoint changes, lighting variations, compounding objects, sensor noise and background distractions.
The benchmark focuses on five core metrics that capture the essential properties of effective progress signals
across multiple tasks and perturbation scenarios.
A.1
Core Evaluation Metrics
• Temporal Correlation: Measures the correlation between progress values and frame numbers across
all tasks using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient:

where N is the number of tasks, Tk is the trajectory length for task k, x(k)
i

and y(k)

where I is the indicator function and r(k)

is the progress at step t for task k. Values closer to 100
indicate stronger monotonic progression.

trajectories across tasks using Maximum Mean Discrepancy:

where Rs,k and R f,k represent final progress values for success and failure trajectories in task k, nk

failure trajectories across tasks:

where M(k) = 1

A.2
Evaluating Progress Reward Quality
A high-quality progress reward function should exhibit several key characteristics that can be assessed through
the following complementary metrics:
• Temporal Consistency: The progress values should demonstrate strong temporal correlation (ρ) with
monotonically increasing patterns (temporal monotonicity Mmono). Effective progress rewards should
show consistent improvement over time, with correlation values approaching 1.0 and monotonicity
scores near 100% indicating smooth, predictable progression toward task completion.
• Distribution Discriminability: Successful and failed trajectories should be well-separated in the
progress reward space. This is quantified through multiple complementary measures:
– Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD): Captures distributional differences in reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces, with larger values indicating better separation between success and failure
trajectories.
– Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD): Measures the information-theoretic divergence between
success and failure distributions, where values closer to ln 2 suggest maximal discriminability.
– Standardized Mean Difference (SMD): Provides an effect size measure for the separation between
success and failure means, with larger absolute values indicating stronger differentiation.
2

SRPO: Self-Referential Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language-Action Models
The combination of these metrics provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating progress reward quality,
emphasizing both the internal consistency within successful trajectories and the external discriminability
between success and failure outcomes.

Reward Analysis Details
Reward construction for success traj. To ensure a fair and standardized comparison, we adopt the following
normalized procedure for progress reward computation: For SRPO and ImageBind, we compute video
embeddings using a cumulative sliding window approach: starting from frames 0-10, we progressively
extend the window through frames 1-11, 1-12, and so forth, until the final window spanning frames 1 to the
penultimate frame, which generates a sequence of embeddings representing cumulative visual context up to
each time step. Then, we compute their L2 distances to the embedding of the entire video sequence, and
normalize the progress reward by assigning a value of 0 to the frame with the maximum distance and 1 to the
frame with the minimum distance. For the pixel-level method (RLVR), we calculate the L1 distance between
each frame from frame 10 to the penultimate frame and the final frame, applying the same normalization
scheme.
Reward construction for failure traj. For failure trajectories, we use the cluster centers of successful
trajectories as reference points. We compute the minimum L2 distance from each failure trajectory segment to
these success cluster centers, then normalize the progress reward by assigning a value of 0 to the segment with
the maximum distance and 1 to the segment with zero distance (closest to success patterns).
Reward Curve Analysis. We randomly selected some successful and failure trajectories, plotting frame
number-progress reward curves to compare our approach with two baseline methods. As shown in Figure 13
14 15, our analysis reveals that pixel-level rewards fail to properly evaluate long-horizon tasks with multiple
sub-tasks and tend to exhibit sharp progress increases only in the final few frames. While general visual
encoders like ImageBind can capture trajectory-level features, these features lack physical intuition, result-
ing in oscillatory progress rewards that are non-smooth and frequently display incorrect sudden spikes or
drops—characteristics particularly unfriendly for reinforcement learning. In contrast, our reward method
demonstrates more reasonable and stable progress estimation. We also provide detailed reward curves for two
trajectories as visualizations in Figure 9.

Figure 10: Ablation study on Object suite. We
compare our SRPO method against its ablated
variants. Removing the referential component
(w/o Referential) leads to significant performance
drop, while removing the clustering component
(w/o Cluster) slows down convergence.
A core design of our method is its self-referential nature,
which assesses progress by comparing within the current
policy’s own rollouts. We hypothesize that relying on a
fixed set of external expert trajectories could constrain the
policy’s exploration and potentially lead to convergence to
suboptimal local minima. To validate this, we ablate the
self-referential mechanism by replacing the within-batch
successful trajectories with a fixed set of 50 pre-selected
expert trajectories per task for progress computation. As
illustrated in Figure 10, the ablated variant initially trains
slightly slower than our full SRPO method, yet still out-
performs GRPO significantly. However, its performance
plateaus in later stages, requiring nearly 1.4 times the
training steps yet still yielding suboptimal results. This
suggests two key insights: (1) The progress-wise reward,
even when computed from external trajectories, provides a
more effective learning signal than sparse binary rewards,
explaining the initial efficiency gain over GRPO, while
the introduction of external information eventually allows
GRPO, which requires no such information, to catch up
it in performance. (2) The fixed external references ulti-
3

SRPO: Self-Referential Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language-Action Models
mately limit the policy’s capacity for open-ended exploration. As the policy evolves, these static trajectories
fail to provide nuanced, step-by-step progress assessments for the diverse rollouts generated by the policy,
leading to a performance ceiling lower than that achieved by our self-referential approach.
C.2
Ablation on Success Clustering
We introduce clustering of successful trajectories to compute progress rewards based on two primary moti-
vations. First, a task can often be accomplished through multiple distinct strategies (e.g., placing object A
before B, or vice versa). A failure trajectory should be compared to the nearest successful strategy rather than
an arbitrary one. Second, using the centroid of a cluster, rather than the single nearest successful trajectory,
provides a more robust distance measure. Individual success trajectories might contain sub-optimal or noisy
segments (e.g., a gripper moving momentarily away from an object before successfully grasping it). If
a failure trajectory shares a similar initial deviation, measuring the distance solely to this specific, noisy
success trajectory could yield an inaccurately high progress score. Using a cluster centroid mitigates this by
representing a more prototypical and cleaner version of a success strategy.
To substantiate these points, we conduct an ablation where progress is computed using the distance to the
single nearest success trajectory instead of the cluster centroid. The results are presented in Figure 10. We
observe that this variant’s initial learning efficiency is comparable to our full SRPO method. However, its
performance gains diminish significantly as training progresses. We attribute this to the following: in early
training stages, the repertoire of successful strategies is limited, and the number of success trajectories is small,
thus diminishing the advantage of clustering. In later stages, as successful exploration diversifies and the
number of success trajectories grows substantially, the ability of clustering to distill prototypical strategies and
provide robust progress signals becomes crucial, leading to the increasing performance gap observed in our
results.

Figure 11: Performance comparison with differ-
ent α values in the reward function. The results
demonstrate that α = 0.8 achieves the best perfor-
mance, followed by α = 1.0, α = 0.5, α = 0.3,
and α = 0 in descending order. This validates the
importance of balancing progress awareness with
outcome correctness in our reward design.
In Equation (5), we employ an activation function to map
the reward trajectory into the range (0, 1). In our imple-
mentation, we use a sigmoid function and precede it with
a scaling coefficient α to control the trade-off between
progress awareness and outcome correctness in our reward
function. We now conduct a comprehensive analysis of
this hyperparameter α. The reward design provides full
credit (1.0) for correct answers and scales the progress
reward by α otherwise. We evaluate five different values
of α: 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0.
The experimental results reveal a clear performance hier-
archy: 0 < 0.3 < 0.5 < 1.0 < 0.8. This pattern provides
several important insights:
α = 0 (no progress reward): Performs worst, confirming
that purely outcome-based rewards are insufficient for
complex tasks requiring sequential reasoning.
α = 0.3 and 0.5: Show gradual improvement, indicat-
ing that even small progress rewards enhance learning
efficiency.
α = 1.0 (equal weighting): Performs better than lower
values but suboptimally, suggesting that over-emphasizing
progress may distract from the final objective.
α = 0.8 (optimal): Achieves the best performance,
demonstrating that a strong but not exclusive focus on
progress rewards (80% of maximum) provides the ideal balance for guiding the learning process while
maintaining focus on task completion.

SRPO: Self-Referential Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language-Action Models
This analysis validates our reward design principle: properly weighted progress awareness (α = 0.8) signifi-
cantly outperforms both purely outcome-based rewards (α = 0) and excessively progress-focused rewards
(α = 1.0). The optimal α value enables the agent to benefit from intermediate guidance while remaining
oriented toward the ultimate task objective.
E
What if we use a pixel-level world model for reward shaping?
Another promising avenue for reward shaping involves leveraging pixel-level world models to generate
reference trajectories based on language instructions or action priors. Since these priors are already inputs
to the policy or RL algorithm, this approach does not strictly constitute introducing external information. In
this section, we use Cosmos-Predict2 (Ali et al., 2025) as a case study to elucidate why this paradigm, while
intuitive, often falls short in practice.
Zero-Shot Generation Yields Unsatisfactory Results. We experimented with the large-scale Cosmos-
Predict2-14B model in a zero-shot setting on several tasks from the LIBERO benchmark. Using the language
instruction as conditioning signals, the model was tasked with generating a reference video trajectory. As
shown in Figure 16, the generated videos suffer from poor scene consistency. Furthermore, although task-
specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may mitigate these inconsistencies and improve generation quality, this
high-cost approach, which relies heavily on extensive expert demonstrations, is clearly inferior to the reward
modeling paradigm proposed by SRPO, which is based on a latent world representation and proves to be more
cost-effective and generalizable.

Model Details
This modified architecture retains the Llama 2 backbone for generating discrete action tokens, in contrast to the
continuous action heads employed in OpenVLA-OFT. While this design choice may potentially sacrifice some
level of action precision compared to continuous output methods, it provides the crucial advantage of enabling
direct access to action log-probabilities essential for policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning.

Real-world Experiment Details
G.1
Detailed Setup
In our physical robot experiments, due to safety concerns associated with online exploration and the significant
time cost of manual resets, we adopted an offline reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. Specifically, our
technical approach integrates the Advantage-Weighted Regression (AWR) strategy (Peng et al., 2019) with
SRPO’s self-referential progress-wise reward and advantage mechanism. We first collect demonstration data
and store it in a trajectory buffer. The expected cumulative reward (or value) Ri,t for the i-th trajectory at step t
is computed as in (2)–(5). We then define the incremental progress at step t as Di,t = Ri,t −Ri,t−1. Following
the SRPO framework, the advantage function is calculated as:
Ai,t = Di,t −µ
σ
,
(15)
where µ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of Di,t computed across all trajectories. Our real-world
task policy is trained from scratch via RL starting from pretrained weights, with the baseline for comparison
being the SFT model.
The pick-and-place tasks include put apple into the plate and put pear into the plate. To test robust object
identification, we place multiple fruits on the table initially, requiring the model to distinguish target objects
from distractors. During task execution, we randomly swap positions between target and distractor objects to
assess the model’s capacity for rapid adaptation.

robot datasets. Our method maintains strong perfor-
mance across all tasks and metrics, demonstrating ro-

To specifically demonstrate the advantages of dense
progress-aware rewards in complex manipulation,
we incorporate folding towels involving deformable
object manipulation and cleaning whiteboard requir-

evaluate semantic understanding capabilities, we in-
clude the select poker task where the model must
identify the specified card from these five playing
cards: Joker, Jack of Spades, King of Club, Jack of
Spades, 10 of Spades.
Our real-world experimental results demonstrate sig-

Rewarding Validation
To quantitatively validate the generalization capability of our progress reward model to real-world scenarios,
we evaluate our pre-trained progress reward function on five real-robot manipulation tasks, each containing 30
successful trajectories and 20 failure trajectories. The comprehensive Progress Reward Benchmark results
across all tasks demonstrate consistent performance in real-world settings:
As shown in Table 4, the consistently high Progress Reward Quality scores across all five real-robot tasks
confirm that our latent progress reward modeling effectively captures task progression dynamics in real-
world robotic manipulation. With near-perfect Spearman correlation and monotonicity, coupled with strong
distribution separation in MMD and SMD, our method demonstrates robust generalization despite domain
shifts from simulation to reality.

Case Study
As shown in Figure 12, our real-world case studies demonstrate the robustness and generalization of our
approach across diverse scenarios: in put the pear into the plate, the policy dynamically replans when the
target is moved mid-execution; in fold the towel, it reliably handles deformable object manipulation; and in
pick up the Joker card, it maintains precise semantic understanding to identify the target among multiple
options. These results validate the adaptability and task-aware capability of our method in challenging real
environments.

(a) Wipe the board. During moving the eraser, there was a process of dropping and picking it up again.
(b) Wipe the board. We found that pausing during grasping can lead to a decrease in progress, as the model 
might consider this action to be unrelated to the final goal.
(c) Manage the table. The robot smoothly approaches the target.
(d) Pick up the joker.
(e) Wipe the board.
(f) Pick up the king of club.
(g) Open the middle drawer of the cabinet + Sensor Noise
