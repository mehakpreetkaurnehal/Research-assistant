Abstract
Biological data sets are often high-dimensional, noisy, and governed by complex interactions among
sparse signals.
This poses major challenges for interpretability and reliable feature selection.
Tasks
such as identifying motif interactions in genomics exemplify these difficulties, as only a small subset
of biologically relevant features (e.g., motifs) are typically active, and their effects are often non-linear
and context-dependent. While statistical approaches often result in more interpretable models, deep
learning models have proven effective in modeling complex interactions and prediction accuracy, yet
their black-box nature limits interpretability.
We introduce BaGGLS, a flexible and interpretable probabilistic binary regression model designed for
high-dimensional biological inference involving feature interactions. BaGGLS incorporates a Bayesian
group global-local shrinkage prior, aligned with the group structure introduced by interaction terms.
This prior encourages sparsity while retaining interpretability, helping to isolate meaningful signals and
suppress noise. To enable scalable inference, we employ a partially factorized variational approximation
that captures posterior skewness and supports efficient learning even in large feature spaces.
In extensive simulations, we compare BaGGLS to frequentist probit regressions (unconstrained and
with L1-penalty) as well as a probit model with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling under a
horseshoe prior. We can show that BaGGLS outperforms the other methods with regard to interaction
detection and is many times faster than MCMC sampling under the horseshoe prior. We also demonstrate
the usefulness of BaGGLS in the context of interaction discovery from motif scanner outputs (e.g., Find
Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO)) and noisy attribution scores from deep learning models. This
shows that BaGGLS is a promising approach for uncovering biologically relevant interaction patterns,
with potential applicability across a range of high-dimensional tasks in computational biology.

Introduction
One of the greatest methodological challenges in the biomedical data domain is feature selection in
high-dimensional data (Borah et al.; 2024; Yang et al.; 2021).
This challenge has historically been
central in genomics, but with deep learning (DL) becoming the dominant analytical paradigm and
post hoc attribution being routinely used for interpretability, the problem manifests in a different and
more intricate form today. DL models excel at learning complex patterns in genomic sequences (Ismail
et al.; 2025), However, the resulting models are highly nonlinear and operate in settings where biological
features are both strongly interactive (Xie et al.; 2025; Forsberg et al.; 2017) and extremely sparse
(Wheeler et al.; 2016). These properties amplify the already difficult task of interpreting which features
matter and, crucially, how they interact.
As a result, we continue to struggle to reliably explain feature interactions (Borah et al.; 2024). This
difficulty is not merely algorithmic, but rooted in statistical challenges. Among these challenges are the
curse of dimensionality, the tendency of interactions to explode combinatorically, sparsity of true effects,
and high noise levels (Giraud; 2021). These challenges are in particularly pronounced when working with
post hoc attribution maps. Attribution scores are often noisy and spurious (Majdandzic et al.; 2023),
and aggregating them to motif-level features produces high-dimensional, sparsely informative predictors
whose reliability and error are difficult to determine. Altogether, this creates a setting in which classical
feature selection approaches fall short, and even modern statistical approaches do not resolve the core
problem reliably.
Consequently, we see a strong need for new methodology that addresses the specific structure of post
hoc attribution in genomic deep learning. Here, we propose a structured binary regression model that
incorporates a large number of potential main effects and interaction terms into its linear predictor.
For interpretability and reliable identification of relevant effects, we impose sparsity on the coefficients.
Within the Bayesian framework, sparsity is naturally enforced through shrinkage priors (George and
McCulloch; 1997; Ishwaran and Rao; 2005; Liang et al.; 2008; Yanchenko and Bondell; 2025). Many
continuous shrinkage priors such as the Bayesian Lasso (Park and Casella; 2008) and the horseshoe
(Carvalho et al.; 2010) follow a global–local structure (Polson and Scott; 2011), in which global parameters
jointly shrink coefficients toward zero while local parameters allow coefficient-specific deviations. Xu
et al. (2017) extend this framework to include group based shrinkage parameters, facilitating structured
regularization when coefficients can be meaningfully organized into groups. The inclusion of interaction
terms results in many overlapping groups, where each group is formed of all terms involving a specific
feature. To accommodate this structure, we extend the group-based shrinkage framework of Xu et al.
(2017), adapting it to handle the extremely large number of potential interaction terms present in genomic
data. A detailed description of the resulting prior structure is provided in Section 2.2.
Exact Bayesian inference in the resulting high-dimensional Bayesian probit model is challenging
and we propose a computationally efficient variational inference (VI;
Blei et al.; 2017) algorithm, a
commonly applied technique in high-dimensional binary regression models (Zhang et al.; 2019; Ray et al.;
2020). Here, we extend the approach of Fasano et al. (2022) to our novel prior and consider a unified
skew–normal (Arrelano-Valle and Azzalini; 2006) approximation for the regression coefficients.
This
allows more flexibility than the commonly employed mean field approximation (e.g., Durante and Rigon;
2019). The unified skew-normal distribution generalizes the Gaussian distribution to include skewness.
Recently, skewness perturbed variational approximations were considered by several authors (e.g., Tan
and Chen; 2025; Kock et al.; 2025; Pozza et al.; 2025) theoretically justified by the skewed Bernstein-von
Mises theorem (Durante et al.; 2024). The unified skew-normal distribution is also a conjugate prior to
the probit model (Durante; 2019; Anceschi et al.; 2023), so that the variational approximation can be
efficiently learned using an analytic coordinate ascent updating scheme (e.g.,
Bishop; 2006; Ray and
Szabó; 2022). This enables scalable inference even when the number of interactions is large.
In this paper, we introduce our novel method called Bayesian Group Global Local Shrinkage
(BaGGLS) in detail and demonstrate through extensive simulations that it outperforms state-of-the-
art methods in both computational efficiency and interpretability. Importantly, we also show empirically
that BaGGLS fills a methodological gap in post hoc analysis of genomic deep learning models. Many
post hoc approaches attempt to understand learned regulatory mechanisms by detecting motifs through
attribution scores (Novakovsky et al.; 2023; Van Hilten et al.; 2024; Bartoszewicz et al.; 2021). Attri-
bution methods assign position-wise scores to sequences, and downstream tools such as TF-MoDISco
(Shrikumar et al.; 2018) extract motifs from these maps. However, these workflows do not capture inter-
actions between motif patterns, even though such interactions are central to many genomic mechanisms
(Xie et al.; 2025).
1

Motif scanners such as FIMO (Grant et al.; 2011) overcome some limitations by identifying matches
to known PWMs from databases like JASPAR (Rauluseviciute et al.; 2024). Yet this produces a high-
dimensional feature space containing hundreds of motifs, many of which produce spurious matches.
When combined with noisy attribution scores, only a small subset of motifs, and often their interaction,
contribute meaningfully to phenotypes. These conditions create exactly the type of high-dimensional,
sparse, interaction-rich scenario where classical methods struggle. We show that BaGGLS successfully
extracts these interacting signals and provides reliable interpretability.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces BaGGLS and an efficient VI
approach to posterior estimation. Section 3 shows the merits of our approach empirically benchmarking it
against state-of-the-art methods while Section 4 illustrates its applicability to high-dimensional biological
data along an application in interaction detection for genomic attribution scores.
Finally, Section 5
concludes. Code is available at gitlab.com/dacs-hpi/baggls.

Bayesian group global-local shrinkage
We formally introduce the model in Section 2.1.
Our novel prior is introduced in Section 2.2, and
Section 2.3 describes our approach for scalable inference.
2.1
Model formulation
We consider the probit model
yi | β ∼Bern(Φ(x⊤
i β))
i = 1, . . . n
(1)
where Bern(π) denotes the Bernoulli distribution with success probability π, Φ is the cumulative distri-
bution function of the standard normal distribution, xi = (xi1, . . . , xip)⊤is a vector of pre-defined effects
including an intercept and interactions, and β ∈Rp is a vector of model parameters to be learned. By
introduction of latent variables z = (z1, . . . , zn)⊤we can augment (1) as
yi = I(zi > 0),
zi | β ∼N(x⊤
i β, 1),
where N(µ, σ2) denotes a normal distribution with mean µ and variance σ2, and I(zi > 0) denotes the
indicator function that takes a value of 1 if zi > 0 and 0 otherwise. This representation yields closed-form
full-conditionals for β and z, which will become useful for the computational efficient inference algorithm
introduced later. The linear predictor xi is derived from a d-dimensional vector mi = (mi1, . . . , mid)⊤
of observed features, i = 1, . . . , n, and contains not only linear effects, but also interaction terms of the
d features as illustrated in Figure 1B. For example, when considering an intercept, linear effects as well
as all possible pairwise multiplicative interactions of the form milmil′, l ̸= l′, the linear predictor x⊤
i β
in (1) can be written as β0 + Pd
l=1 βlml + Pd
l=1
P
l′>l βll′mlml′. Hence, p is typically much larger than
d. This is the structure we consider in Section 4 when we apply BaGGLS to interaction discovery from
motif scanner outputs. In this case mi will be a vector of attribution scores derived from a deep learning
architecture. However, our general framework allows us to specify arbitrary effect and interaction terms.
In this context, it is important to note that first, even for small and moderate d, the number of potential
interactions is large and thus xi can be high-dimensional. Second, we also explicitly allow for much larger
p than the sample size n, that is, p ≫n.
2.2
Overlapping group horseshoe prior
If the number of potential effect terms p is large, (1) can be challenging to interpret. Based on common
scenarios in biological applications, we make the following assumptions. (i) We assume that β is sparse.
That is, most entries are zero and thus only a small number of effect terms, xij, influence yi. (ii) We
further assume, that only a small subset of features mil significantly influences y and thus for most
features all terms involving that feature are jointly zero.
The first assumption can be incorporated by considering an appropriate shrinkage prior. The prior
structure also acts as an important regularization to the high-dimensional regression model. Here, we
build on the popular horseshoe prior (Carvalho et al.; 2010). The horseshoe prior introduces a global
shrinkage parameter τ controlling the overall level of shrinkage jointly for all predictors and local shrinkage
parameters λj j = 1, . . . , p controlling the shrinkage for the coefficient βj corresponding to effect xij. Xu
et al. (2017) extend this prior structure to account for group-based shrinkage. The heredity assumption

Figure 1: Schematic description of the BaGGLS-workflow. A) Feature selection based on the observed
data. In our application discussed in Section 4, we use attribution scores from CNNs trained on FIMO
matches. B) Based on expert knowledge a pre-defined set of potential effects including interpretable
interactions is defined. C) Our novel overlapping group horseshoe prior matches the structure of the
pre-defined effect terms and allows for global, local, and feature dependent shrinkage of the regression
coefficients. D) Scalable Bayesian inference is carried our by projecting the true posterior onto a tractable
family of variational posteriors Q. E) The prior shrinks most regression coefficients towards 0 resulting
in a sparse and interpretable regression model. F) For interpretation, we propose to rank the effects
based on absolute magnitude of their corresponding coefficients in the logistic regression model.
(ii) implies a structure with many overlapping groups.
This would necessitate a prohibitively large
number of hierarchies in the group horseshoe prior by Xu et al. (2017). We thus propose the following
alternation to their grouped global-local shrinkage prior that circumvents the need for many hierarchies

Here, IG(α, β) denotes an inverse Gamma distribution
with shape parameter α and scale parameter β. As for the standard horseshoe prior τ controls global
shrinkage, and λj controls local shrinkage. In addition, δl controls joint group shrinkage for all effects
including feature ml. The structure of the indicator matrix J informing the grouping structure depends
on the effects considered in x and needs to be specified upfront. To allow for consistent interpretation of
the effect strength as well as consistent shrinkage through the shared shrinkage parameters we assume
that all effects xij, j = 1, . . . , p, are standardized to have unit scale across observations, i = 1, . . . , n. A
schematic description of our prior is given in Figure 1C. Each term has an individual local shrinkage
parameter λj. The motif dependent group shrinkage parameter δl is active exactly for the terms involving
the corresponding feature ml. The parameter τ controls global shrinkage and is shared across all terms.

2.3
Inference for large data sets
Exact Bayesian inference in the high-dimensional probit model can be computationally challenging. VI
emerged as a powerful alternative. The main idea illustrated in Figure 1D is to learn an approximation
to the posterior density p(θ | y) using an approximating family of densities Q. Most commonly, the
optimal approximation q∗(θ) is chosen so that it minimizes the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence,
DKL [q(θ) || p(θ | y))] = Eq [log q(θ) −log p(θ | y)] ,
where Eq[·] denotes expectation with respect to q(θ), among all approximating families in Q. A popular
choice in logistic and probit regression models is the mean field assumption (e.g., Durante and Rigon;
2019), which assumes independence between specific blocks of θ. This choice is computational efficient,
but as recently shown by Fasano et al. (2022) can be too restrictive for large p. Therefore, the authors
propose to relax the independence assumption between β and z.
This allows for more flexibility in
the posterior approximation, as it yields a unified skew–normal (Arrelano-Valle and Azzalini; 2006)
approximation for the vector of regression coefficients. Fasano et al. (2022) consider a simple Gaussian
prior for β. We extend their approach to the Gaussian scale mixture representation of the BaGGLS prior
and consider variational approximations of the form
Q =

.
We describe how q∗(θ) = arg minq(θ)∈Q DKL [q(θ) || p(θ | y))] can be derived in a computational at-
tractive manner using a simple coordinate ascent algorithm. The final algorithm updates one variational
factor at a time while holding the others fixed, cycling through coordinates until convergence. Under
the variational family Q given above all updates are in closed-form (see Appendix A). It is possible to
efficiently sample from q(β) =
R
q(β | z)q(z)dz even when p ≫n using the strategies outlined in Bhat-
tacharya et al. (2016) and the posterior mean bβ = Eq[β] is given in closed form. Due to the variational
approximation, samples from q∗(θ) will not yield exact uncertainty quantification, and we use the point
estimator bβ for out of sample prediction and interpretation of the regression model.

Illustrative example
Data generating process
We generate m = 500 data sets with n = 500 independent observations.
For mi = (mi1, . . . , mid) with mij ∼G(1, 1), similar as in our application presented in Section 4 the
corresponding vector of predictors xi consists of an intercept, linear effects mj, j = 1, . . . , d, and all
possible pairwise interactions mjmj′ for j < j′. We set d = 10, so that p = 56 in our first set-up.
After standardization of the design matrix, we generate observations yi ∼Bern(Φ(x⊤
i β∗)), where all
entries of β∗are zero except for the entries corresponding to m1, m2, and the interaction m1m2. The
true regression coefficient β∗is thus extremely sparse and reflects the sparsity assumption described in
Section 2.2.
Benchmark methods
We consider different regularization techniques for the probit model (1) that
result in sparse and interpretable models. We use the same design matrix for all benchmarks, so that
the models are directly comparable. In particular, we compare BaGGLS with the following benchmarks:
UC: Unconstrained frequentist probit regression fitted via maximum likelihood,
L1: Frequentist probit regression with L1-penalty and default hyperparameters as implemented in
statsmodels (Seabold and Perktold; 2010),
HS: MCMC sampling for the probit model equipped with the horseshoe prior (Carvalho et al.;
2010) as implemented in brms (Bürkner; 2017).
Results
Figure 2A shows boxplots of the root mean squared error (RMSE), RMSE(bβ)

, over the 500 independent repetitions. BaGGLS has the smallest average RMSE
(0.7022), followed by HS (0.8052), and L1 (1.3827). Figure 2B plots estimates bβj for all coefficients
with β∗
j = 0 showing effective shrinkage toward zero. As expected, the largest variability occurs for joint
effects involving m1 or m2. Non-zero effects (β∗
j ̸= 0) are are accurately recovered (Figure 2C). Figure 2D
shows a histogram for a representative non-informative coeffiencent under BaGGLS and under HS from
their respective marginal posteriors. Both are centered near zero and on a similar scale. Notably, the
marginal posterior q(βj) under BaGGLS is skewed, which is captured due to the unified skew-normal
variational family. However, this family cannot capture the characteristic spike around zero. For a rep-
resentative non-zero coefficient (Figure 2E), BaGGLS concentrates more tightly around the truth, while
HS posteriors are more dispersed. Nevertheless, both methods yield similar posterior means. Due to the
variational approximation, posterior samples from BaGGLS will not yield exact uncertainty quantifica-
tion. On this data, BaGGLS takes on average only 0.59 seconds and is therefore more then 100 times
faster then MCMC sampling under the horseshoe prior rendering it suitable for large scale applications.
3.2
Scalability
Data generating process
To further investigate the performance of BaGGLS we now vary the number
of observations n and the number of observed features d in the data generative process described in
Section 3.1. Due to the non-linear relationship between d and the number of effects p a slight increase
in d leads to a large increase in p and thus to a much more challenging inference task. Here, we consider
n = 500 and n = 2, 000 as well as d = 10, 15, 20 resulting in a total of 6 scenarios. These values are
chosen to reflect common scenarios in real world data and result in a small sample-to-feature ratio n/p.
This matches the general structure of the genomic data considered in Section 4.
Performance metrics
In addition to the overall RMSE, we consider several other performance met-
rics. First, we evaluate discrimination via the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC) and probabilistic accuracy via the Brier score, n−1 Pn
i=1(Φ(x⊤
i bβ) −yi)2, both evaluated on an
additional hold-out test data set with n = 10, 000 observations. The Brier score is a proper scoring
rule (Gneiting and Raftery; 2007). These metrics are useful in comparing the out-of-sample predictive
power of the different methods. Although prediction is not the primary objective of BaGGLS, reasonable
out-of-sample performance remains desirable. However, when prediction is the main goal rather than
interpretability, methods with weaker structural assumptions may be more suitable. To quantify effect

recovery in high dimensions, we report RMSE computed separately over the active (nonzero) and inactive

are ranked among the top 20 and, separately, among the top 3 estimated effects by absolute magnitude.
As a measure of overall sparsity in the predictor bβ, we report the ratio (P

as a proxy for the effective number of active coefficients. Under the true vector β∗this ratio takes the
value 2.8575. Lastly, we report average computation times on a standard laptop for all benchmarks.
Results
Values for RMSEs, AUC, the Brier score, and the run times are reported in Appendix B.
BaGGLS is compatible with the benchmark methods in terms of out of sample prediction measured
by AUC and the Brier score, while more effective at detecting the active terms. Across all simulation
scenarios, BaGGLS achieves the lowest RMSE on the active (nonzero) entries of β∗followed by HS. HS
imposes stronger shrinkage on zero coefficients as measured by the RMSE on the inactive components,
particularly in scenarios with n = 2, 000, where the sample-to-feature ratio n/p is larger than in scenarios
with n = 500. In the application considered in Section 4 the sample-to-feature ratio n/p = 1.33 is small.
Table 1 reports the proportion of repetitions in which the three truly active terms are ranked among
the top 20 and, separately, among the top 3 estimated effects by absolute magnitude. While L1 and
UR do not recover the active effects reliably, HS and BaGGLS place all three truly active effects in the
top 20 for every run across all scenarios. However, BaGGLS outperforms HS when considering only the

intercation appears in the top 3 in 88 of 100 repetitions for HS versus 93 of 100 for BaGGLS. Similarly,
for n = 500, d = 15, BaGGLS detects the interaction 93 times, while HS places it outside the top 3 in
16% of runs. These results indicate that BaGGLS is robust at detecting interaction effects, especially
when the sample-to-feature ratio is small. In addition, BaGGLS is between 7 and 122 times faster than

Application to genomic attribution scores
In this section, we illustrate how BaGGLS is useful as a post hoc processing method for genomic deep
learning explanations. To this end, we apply BaGGLS to attribution scores derived from deep learning
models trained on synthetic genomic sequences containing real motifs and a known ground truth.
Data and motif scanning
The dataset consists of synthetic DNA sequences with binary labels in-
dicating the presence of a motif set of interest. We follow a similar simulation protocol as described in
Tseng et al. (2024) to evaluate the approach on known ground truth. Depending on the defined motif
grammar, the motifs are inserted in randomly generated sequence. Here, we explored the REST motif
consisting of two submotifs with a specific order and spacing (Figure 3A). 35,000 sequences are generated
for training and 10,000 for validation, with a sequence length of 500 base pairs. To evaluate BaGGLS, we
generated additional 45 evaluation datasets with the same grammar each consisting of 2,000 sequences.
FIMO (Grant et al.; 2011) locates motifs by computing significant matches of motifs with position-
weight matrices (PWM) from databases in a sequence. Here, we use all latest versions of the human
7

transcription binding site motifs (d = 755) in JASPAR2024 (Rauluseviciute et al.; 2024). Depending on
the threshold for the p-value, the results can contain many false positive matches (high threshold) or
miss some of the real motif matches (low threshold). We use the default threshold pthresh = 1e−4 to
investigate the robustness of BaGGLS by exposing it to noisy motif matches by allowing false positives
as well as relevant motifs which are not matched by FIMO despite being present.
Attribution scores from deep learning models
We train five shallow convolutional neural networks
(CNN) on the training data set. We specifically use a simple architecture to not overfit to the synthetic
data resulting in an average AUC of 0.91. Details on the architecture and performance can be found
in the supplement section C. The trained CNNs are interpreted by the post-hoc attribution method
Integrated Gradients (Sundararajan et al.; 2017) to obtain position-wise attribution scores which indicate
the contribution of one position to the over-all output of an input sequence. We calculate the scores for
all evaluation data sets for each of the five CNNs.
Attribution-based design matrix
BaGGLS requires a pre-defined set of features and interactions
passed in a design matrix (Figure 1B). Here, we pass all matched motifs by FIMO as possible features
to BaGGLS. FIMO returns the start and end positions of the matched motifs within each sequence.
With that information, we can aggregate the attribution scores in that subregion to obtain motif-wise
contributions.
Here, we use the absolute average from the attribution scores at the matched motif
positions scaled sequence-wise so that the aggregated motif scores add up to 1. To create interaction
features, we calculate the pairwise co-activation based on the product of the average contribution scores.
We remove rarely occurring features to avoid inefficiency due to a very large number of features by using
a cut-off quantile of 0.95 which can be adjusted by the user. The resulting features still comprise of a
large number of motif and interaction features (p=1,500), resulting in a ratio of n\p = 1.33 similar to
the scenarios considered in Section 3. The design matrix consists of 755 single effects and 745 interaction
effects. Similarly as in the simulation, we fit BaGGLS for each of the 45 evaluation data sets for each of
the 5 CNNs. In total, this results in 225 different scenarios.
Attribution evaluation
Due to the sparsity assumption only a small sub-set of regression coefficients
bβ derived by BaGGLS is meaningfully different from 0. This is the set of effectively active feature and
interaction effects detected by BaGGLS. For further interpretation, we calculate the top-20 effects by
absolute magnitude of their respective coefficients (see Figure 1F). This can be viewed as the set of the
most important 20 effects out of the p = 1, 500 potential effects initially passed to our method.
For illustration purposes, we consider here data with a known ground truth.
This allows us to
evaluate whether BaGGLS captures the known main interaction, by checking how often the interaction
is included within the top-20 effects. BaGGLS identifies the interaction term in 82,7% of the scenarios
whereas the REST submotifs were included within the top-20 in 68.4% and 76.6% of the scenarios,
respectively (Figure 3A). It is important to note that when using BaGGLS as post-processing method,
its performance is highly dependent on the fit of the base CNN. In particular BaGGLS cannot detect
effects that were overlooked by the base model. When analyzing at the rankings of the terms for each
of the five CNN models individually (Figure 3B), the interaction term ranks on average higher than the
individual submotif effects for each model (Median ranks: interaction term = 4, REST1 = 15, REST2
= 14). This shows that BaGGLS robustly identifies the driving interaction among noisy attribution
scores and prioritizes the interaction over individual effects. For this reason, BaGGLS can be used as
highly interpretable post-hoc processing method for trained deep learning genomic classifiers. Identifying
important interactions is not directly possible from the black-box CNNs, but crucial for understanding
the underlying biological process.

Discussion
We propose BaGGLS, an interaction detection method for high-dimensional and noisy biological data. To
this end, we make the following main contributions. (i) We propose to use a structured probit regression
model as a post-hoc analysis tool for deep classifiers.
Our model takes a large number of potential
effect, including interactions, as input and identifies a small subset of important and truly active effects.
(ii) Sparsity is imposed through a novel shrinkage prior that respects the overlapping group structure
resulting from the inclusion of many interaction terms in the additive predictor. (iii) We propose a
fast algorithm for posterior inference based on a unified skewed-normal approximation. This is crucial

Figure 3: Post-processing of BaGGLS on attribution scores. (A) First, we generated synthetic sequences
by inserting the sampled composite REST motif in 500bp long random sequences.
We trained five
shallow CNN models on that data and interpreted the test data with Integrated Gradients. By applying
FIMO on the sequences, we obtain matches which resemble motifs from the JASPAR2024 data base. We
average the attribution scores in the matched motif region and compute the design matrix and indicator
matrix from those scores for BaGGLS.(B) We applied BaGGLS on the 45 test data sets for each model
and measured how often the interaction term was included in the Top 20 terms. BaGGLS ranks the
interaction term on average in 82.7% of the test data sets as a top 20 effect while the individual effects in
68.4% and 76.6% for the first and second half of the REST motif respectively (left plot). When looking
closer to the exact ranking of the identified terms (right plot), the interaction term receives much higher
ranking than the individual effects.
for scalability to scenarios with many potential effects and a a small sample-to-feature ratio. (iv) We
conduct an extensive simulation study, and show that BaGGLS outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks
in detecting relevant interaction effects. (v) We illustrate the merits of our approach in an application
on motif interactions in genomic data which is known to be complex and noisy offering a good use case
for comparisons.
Even though, our general framework allows for arbitrary and more complex effect types to be spec-
ified, we have only considered continuous features and interactions based on co-occurrences within our
application. The inclusion of more complex effects, for example, by including binary features and boolean
interactions in the context of logic regression (Ruczinski et al.; 2003) coupled with regulatory logic in
genomics (Buchler et al.; 2003) is a promising direction.

Combining our novel overlapping group shrinkage prior with regression models beyond the probit
model, is a further avenue for future research. For example, current deep learning prediction tasks in the
genomic domain shift from classification to continuous and categorical responses by considering biological
signals like gene expression or read counts directly. Quantitative readouts provide a more fine-grained
picture of a biological signal. Extending BaGGLS to continuous responses might be one pathway to
account for low-affinity motifs which are sometimes ignored due to thresholds by peak calling methods
(Zeitlinger; 2020).
While we demonstrate application to motif detection, other biological domains can also benefit from
BaGGLS. In genetics, single-nucleotide polymorphisms are studied in the context of disease. While rare
disorders are frequently driven by individual variants with large effects, common-variant contributions to
complex traits are highly polygenic and often involve context-dependent effects that are hard to resolve
in high-dimensional genotype space (Wray et al.; 2018). Currently, regulatory genomics is shifting from
bulk assays to single-cell and related high-resolution assays. These provide finer cell-type specificity but
produce sparser, noisier data matrices that change the statistical challenges and opportunities (Bouland
et al.; 2023). This shift opens new applications for BaGGLS.
However, there are also limitations visible in the presented use case. In some genomic regions, compos-
ite regulatory elements, which are arrangements of multiple nearby binding sites, can alter local sequence
preferences and functional readout (Jolma et al.; 2015). Bulk models that assume independent binding
sites often miss these dependencies, which leads to only a sparse but important set of interactions being
captured. Adjusting the design matrix to include interaction terms based on experimentally validated
composite elements can therefore make interaction interpretations more precise. This can further be
improved by an iterative approach in which interpretable features from deep models, for example, convo-
lutional filters (Tseng et al.; 2024) or in-silico perturbation readouts (Gjoni and Pollard; 2024), are used
to detect candidate composite arrangements that are then incorporated into the design matrix to refine
sparsity structure and interaction estimates. The interaction patterns detected by our method could
also serve as hypotheses for previously unrecognized composite elements or motif interactions. These hy-
potheses can be ranked by BaGGLS and subsequently tested in targeted biochemical or reporter assays,
providing a systematic way to identify novel regulatory interactions.

The structure (2) implies that q∗(β | z) is a p-

We refer to Fasano et al. (2022) for technical details in the derivation of q∗(β, z). Using this set of
equations q∗(θ) can be updated via coordinate ascent (Bishop; 2006).
Note that each step involves
inverting the p × p dimensional matrix Σ(β). If p > n, the Woodbury matrix identity is used to invert a
lower dimensional n × n matrix instead.

Additional simulation results
Table 2 summarizes the overall RMSE, the RMSE computed separately on the active (nonzero) and
inactive (zero) entries of β∗, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the
Brier score, n−1 Pn
i=1(Φ(x⊤
i bβ) −yi)2, evaluated on an additional hold-out test data set with n = 10, 000

Average values and standard deviations (in brackets) across all independent
repetitions for the six simulation scenarios for the overall RMSE, the RMSE computed on the active
(nonzero) and inactive (zero) entries of β∗, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC), and the Brier score, as well as the average computation times. Bold values indicate the best
performing method in terms of the best mean value as well as methods potentially tied according to a
one-sided t-test with level α = 0.05. UR did not reliably converge for the scenario n = 500, d = 20.

Application to genomic attribution scores
This section gives additional details on the deep learning models considered within our application
presented in Section 4 of the main paper. The architecture first employs a one-dimensional convolutional
layer with 8 filters (kernel size = 8), designed to scan the input sequences for motif patterns. The output
of this layer is processed by a ReLU activation function and batch normalization. This is followed by two
fully connected layers, each with 16 units and ReLU activations. To mitigate overfitting, a dropout layer
with a rate of 0.3 is applied after each fully connected layer. The architecture concludes with a dense
output layer followed by a sigmoid activation function, which outputs a probability score representing
the likelihood of the input sequence containing the target motif set. We trained 5 models and evaluated
the predictive performance on a separate test data set consisting of 2000 samples (see Table 3).

AUC are calculated on each dataset separately, since they were used separately for fitting BaGGLS. On
average, an AUC of 0.91 could be achieved.
