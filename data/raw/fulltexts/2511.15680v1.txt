After the pandemic, a new form of "pop-up city" has emerged—co-living gatherings of 100–200 people for 4–8 weeks that
differ from conferences and hack houses. These temporary intentional communities leverages existing urban infrastructure,
blending daily life (housing, meals, care) with self-organized activities like learning, creating, and socializing. They coordinate
bottom-up programming through an "unconference" system for identity, calendaring, RSVP, and social discovery that fosters
spontaneous, serendipitous, enduring ties. This paper examines the design of "Social Layer," an unconferencing system for
pop-up cities. We studied its real-world deployment in ShanHaiWoo (Jilin, China, 2023), muChiangmai (Chiangmai, Thailand,
2023), Edge Esmeralda, Edge Esmeralda (Healdsburg, CA,USA, 2024), Aleph (Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2024), and Gathering of
Tribe (Lisbon, Portugal, 2024). Our findings distill: (1) the strong concept "scaffolded spontaneity"—infrastructural affordances
that balance structure with openness, amplifying participant agency while maintaining privacy and lightweight governance;
(2) design implications for design researchers working on pop-up cities.

Introduction
For most of modern history, sustained co-living has meant marriage and family life, student residencies in
universities, or long-term inhabitation of cities. Shorter formats—workshops, festivals, conferences—create bursts
of co-presence and exchange but rarely support the texture of everyday life together. After pandemic, emerging
between these poles is a form of collaborative living that is longer than a conference yet shorter than a graduate
program: "pop-up cities" [Saleh 2024]—multi-week, residential, self-organized, and thematically oriented cohorts
that occupy or overlay existing urban infrastructures. Participants work, learn, and live together while co-creating
an evolving program of events, projects, and rituals. They function as situated experiments in how strangers
become collaborators, how programs take shape without planners, and how communities organize themselves in
time-bounded worlds.
Pop-up cities expose systemic tensions—openness versus safety, spontaneity versus coordination, porous
boundaries versus coherent identity—requiring designs that shape relational conditions rather than discrete
features. We take “infrastructure” in the CSCW sense—as relational, emergent, and enabling rather than merely
technical [Hillgren et al. 2011; Karasti 2014; Le Dantec and DiSalvo 2013; Star 1999; Star and Bowker 2010; Star
and Ruhleder 1994]. A socio-technical infrastructure for pop-up cities must make participation visible and legible
[Erickson and Kellogg 2000]), lower activation energy for hosting and attending, protect privacy while establishing
trust, and allow communities to “breathe”—tightening to converge, loosening to explore. Designing for pop-up
cities also requires attending to emergent social networks [Ahrens 2018], understanding how infrastructures
shape opportunities [Murphy and Jones 2020, 2021], and treating friction as generative rather than eliminable
[Ozkaramanli 2022]. Serendipity research further highlights the roles of affordances, discovery, and structured
openness [André et al. 2009; Björneborn 2017; Busch 2024; Kotkov et al. 2016; Makri and Blandford 2012], while
social network theory emphasizes weak ties, brokerage, and small-world mixing [Burt 2004; Granovetter 1973;
Uzzi and Spiro 2005].
Designing for such temporary intentional communities requires rethinking "program." Conferences rely on
detailed schedules, expert-curated tracks, and tightly managed keynote economies. Degree programs build
semester arcs, syllabi, assessments, and credentialing. Both are heavyweight, predictable, and optimized for
coordination under certainty. By contrast, pop-up cities aim for what participants often describe as "serendipitous
criticality": enough structure to build trust, safety, momentum, and activation; enough openness to enable
discovery, self-direction, and serendipity. This aligns with systemic design principles emphasizing emergent
behaviors, and evolutionary change [van der Bijl-Brouwer et al. 2024; van der Bijl-Brouwer and Malcolm 2020].
These communities blend the weak structures of unconferences [Park et al. 2023] with the everydayness of
co-living. This raises a core question for HCI and design research:
How can we design infrastructures for serendipity at the scale of a temporary city, and what key characteristics
support it?
This paper reports our findings through a Research-Through-Design [Zimmerman and Forlizzi 2014] process
involving continuous design and deployment of "Social Layer"1, a modular online infrastructure supporting
serendipitous co-living in pop-up cities. It scaffolds spontaneity within temporary intentional communities and
reconfigures relational conditions through privacy-preserving credentials for identity and trust, lightweight event
initiation and RSVP mechanics, visibility cues, and tools for social discovery and portable community memory.
We distill our knowledge through deployments in real-world communities—as "living laboratories" [Björgvinsson
et al. 2010; Karasti 2014; Pipek and Wulf 2009].
We contribute: (1) an real-world exploration of pop-up city infrastructure as a systemic design space within
temporary urbanism and intentional community [Bishop and Williams 2012; Firth 2019; Meijering et al. 2007;
Quinn 2025; Sager 2018]; (2) an articulation of Social Layer as an infrastructural intervention that modulates

emergent serendipitous co-living in pop-up cities; and (3) design implications centered on the strong concept
of "scaffolded spontaneity"—operating near the edge of chaos [Holland 2003; Kauffman 1993]—which supports
serendipity, trust, plurality, and collective agency in time-bounded worlds.

Background
2.1
Intentional Communities, Temporary Urbanism, and Pop-up Cities
Human experiments in intentional community have a long history. From ecovillages and artist colonies to
1970s utopian communes and contemporary co-living startups, such initiatives explore alternative forms of
collective living, governance, and social innovation [Brown 2002; Shenker 3 31]. They often reconfigure daily
life—housing, work, leisure, decision-making—around shared values. While many communities remain small or
persistent, recent years have seen the rise of temporary intentional communities, bringing large groups together
for bounded periods. Some evolve into long-term formations, echoing historical precedents such as Chautauqua2,
demonstrating potential for sustained social experimentation.
Urban studies frame “Temporary Urbanism” as tactical, cultural, and strategic interventions that reconfigure
space and social relations [Andres 2025; Bishop and Williams 2012; Firth 2019; Mould 2014; Schuster 2001;
Stevens and Dovey 2023]. Festivals, pop-ups, and residencies mobilize existing urban infrastructures while
layering temporary civic order. Burning Man illustrates temporary cities as socio-cultural infrastructures shaping
identities, practices, and collaborative production [Chen 2012; Smith et al. 2022; Turner 2009].
Pop-up cities inherit this lineage but extend it toward hybrid work–learning–living arrangements, often among
digitally networked residents. Zuzalu3 assembles a temporary, invitation-based community to co-live and co-work
around technology, governance, and decentralized innovation, functioning as a living lab for prototyping social
forms, governance models, and collaborative practices [Fitzpatrick et al. 2024; Landa-Avila et al. 2022; Pereno and
Aulisio 2025; van der Bijl-Brouwer and Malcolm 2020]. Inspired by Zuzalu, similar pop-up cities have emerged
globally4, using temporary, mission-driven settlements to build intentional communities and test ideas that
typically circulate only online. These arrangements foreground emergent networks, relational infrastructures,
improvisation at scale, and methodologically pluralistic approaches, reflecting systemic design’s emphasis on
multiple epistemologies and reflective practice [Fitzpatrick et al. 2024; van der Bijl-Brouwer et al. 2024].
2.2
Serendipity and Groupware
Serendipity—positive, meaningful, and unexpected discovery—has been studied across information science,
HCI, and organizational scholarship [André et al. 2009; Busch 2024; Copeland 2019; Makri and Blandford 2012;
McCay-Peet and Toms 2011]. Rather than discrete events, serendipitous experiences emerge relationally under
exposure, novelty, and interpretive readiness. Computational systems operationalize serendipity via novelty,
diversity, and coverage [Ge et al. 2010; Kotkov et al. 2016], increasing the probability of meaningful encounters
without over-determining interactions.
Organizational scholarship connects weak-tie bridging and network range to creativity and innovation [Burt
2004; Granovetter 1973; Tortoriello et al. 2012; Uzzi and Spiro 2005]. These studies show that individuals embedded
in diverse and loosely coupled networks are more likely to access non-redundant information, encounter divergent
perspectives, and form novel collaborations [Frydenberg 2024]. Urban research on “third places” [Oldenburg
1997] and social infrastructure [Klinenberg 2018] shows informal environments fostering micro-encounters
and broader social cohesion. Designing for serendipity entails cultivating affordances, enhancing visibility and
legibility (social translucence), and enabling gentle temporal rhythms [Björneborn 2017; Busch and Barkema

2021; Erickson and Kellogg 2000]. In pop-up cities, these principles intersect with systemic design methods, as
participatory and embodied practices structure emergent learning, collaboration, and reflection [Fitzpatrick et al.
2024].
2.3
Infrastructuring for Unconferencing, Events, and Temporary Co-living
“Infrastructure” in CSCW and STS is relational and becomes visible through breakdowns or design interventions
[Star 1999; Star and Ruhleder 1994]. Infrastructuring foregrounds ongoing socio-material work and coordination
across heterogeneous actors, often via boundary objects [Björgvinsson et al. 2010; Bowker and Star 1999; Karasti
2014; Pipek and Wulf 2009; Star 1989]. Contemporary platforms blur lines between application and infrastructure
[Plantin et al. 2018a,b].
Pop-up cities layer municipal and digital infrastructures, combining Open Space Technology principles with
everyday logistics [Owen 2008]. OST self-organizing mechanisms structure emergent participation while main-
taining coherence. Social Layer 5 operationalizes this stance digitally, supporting the continuous surfacing of
invitations, RSVP, and gentle coordination. Trust and privacy are supported through identity systems enabling
“proofs without disclosure” (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs, Zupass6) and proof-of-attendance artifacts (POAPs7)
that record participation without centralizing identity.
These arrangements exemplify how systemic design scaffolds emergent community practices, balances open-
ness and safety, and integrates infrastructure, rhythms, and technology into cohesive experimental ecosystems
[Aulisio et al. 2024; Fitzpatrick et al. 2024; Goss et al. 2024; Pereno and Aulisio 2025; van der Bijl-Brouwer et al.
2024; van der Bijl-Brouwer and Malcolm 2020]. These studies highlight the methodological pluralism of systemic
design, showing how multiple approaches, reflective practices, and context-sensitive strategies inform the design
of complex communities.
3
Method
We follow a research-through-design (RtD) approach [Bowers 2012; Gaver 2012; Zimmerman and Forlizzi 2014;
Zimmerman et al. 2007, 2010], analyzing the Social Layer artifact in use across multiple deployments while
iteratively refining its architecture to investigate how infrastructural design can scaffold serendipity in temporary
intentional communities.
Rather than formulating a fixed hypothesis and running controlled experiments, we:
• Co-designed and implemented Social Layer with organizers of pop-up cities;
• Deployed and adapted the system across multiple
• Analysed how infrastructural choices shaped participation, serendipity, and memory.
The authors were embedded as designers, facilitators, and participants in several of the deployments. This
insider–outsider position afforded rich access to configuration decisions, breakdowns, and emergent practices,
while also requiring reflexive attention to our own role in shaping the phenomena we study.
Our inquiry integrates three complementary strands of data: (1) Public and archival materials documenting
community operations, programs, and schedules across five deployments (e.g., ShanHaiWoo, muChiangmai, Edge
Esmeralda, Aleph, Gathering of Tribe); (2) Design and facilitation field notes generated through ongoing
participation in system integration, onboarding, and community governance; and (3) Platform artifacts and
interaction traces, including configuration schemas, event logs, and interface iterations of the Social Layer
system. Together, these sources provide a multi-scalar perspective—from system architecture and community
design choices to participants’ situated improvisations.

Fig. 2. Solar Layer is a modular infrastructure for the design, scale, and sustainability of pop-up communities and cities.
We conducted an interpretivist thematic analysis [Braun and Clarke 2021], sensitized by concepts from
infrastructuring [Karasti 2014; Pipek and Wulf 2009] and social translucence [Erickson and Kellogg 2000].
We coded the data in three stages: firstly, identifying material and social arrangements that shaped participation
(e.g., visibility, modularity, portability); secondly, tracing how these arrangements enabled emergent coordination
or trust; and thirdly, abstracting design patterns that constitute the “social layer” as an infrastructural condition
for serendipity.

System Design: Solar Layer
Social Layer was conceived not as a discrete “app” but as a living infrastructural ensemble co-developed with
and within temporal intentional communities. From its earliest prototypes, the system has evolved through
cycles of deployment, feedback, and re-composition in contexts such as pop-up cities and residency-style
gatherings. Each iteration translated tacit organizer knowledge—how to convene, announce, and host—into
concrete interface elements: buttons, forms, and flows that scaffold collective action. In this sense, Social Layer
embodies infrastructuring rather than engineering: it is continually shaped by the very communities it supports.
4.1
Design Principles
4.1.1
Identity and Trust. In temporary or nomadic communities, trust must be established quickly and main-
tained without relying on heavy credential systems. Social Layer integrates privacy-preserving credentials and
lightweight verification cues that allow participants to recognise one another without disclosing unnecessary

personal data. Profiles operate less as static self-descriptions and more as “trust surfaces”—showing enough about
someone’s presence, history, and contributions to enable accountability without collapsing privacy boundaries.
Different communities articulate different notions of membership and belonging. To accommodate this, Social
Layer supports configurable boundary modules: communities can define how identity is verified (for example,
invitation tokens, wallet-based proof of participation, peer approval, or open registration). These modular
boundaries are not only security mechanisms but also social structures—ways of defining how open or bounded a
collective should be. This flexibility enables communities to experiment with new governance models and iterate
their own norms of trust.
4.1.2
Unconference-Style Event Initiation. The core interaction model re-imagines event creation as an act of
invitation rather than administration. Any participant can propose a gathering—an impromptu talk, dinner, or co-
working session—by entering minimal information (“what,” “where,” “when”). Events emerge from the periphery
of attention rather than from top-down schedules, aligning with the improvisational logic of unconferences and
pop-up cities.
The system supports dynamic rescheduling and conflict prevention: participants can adjust times or locations
and the platform detects overlapping uses of shared spaces. This reduces the need for dedicated coordinators
and releases organisers from heavy logistical labour, allowing them to focus on facilitating content and dialogue
instead.
Communities may also define their own rules of structure—for instance, detailed booking policies or sponta-
neous room allocation—and these can be adjusted over time. Unlike many commercial SaaS systems where rules
are hard-coded, Social Layer treats structure itself as an editable layer. This allows communities to collectively
negotiate and iterate norms for shared space usage.
4.1.3
RSVP and Presence Cues. Attendance in pop-up environments is fluid; people drift between sessions, meals,
and projects. Social Layer therefore adopts a lightweight RSVP rather than strict registration. The interface
provides affordances for varying degrees of formality as will ; hosts of structured gatherings may activate a
simple check-in process with the QR code and the camera in their mobile if needed. And the participant list
indicator who is having a mutual topic.
These cues enact social translucence: they make participation visible enough to coordinate, while preserv-
ing the ambiguity necessary for serendipitous encounters. The map interface visualises upcoming or nearby
events, supporting low-commitment exploration—participants can discover “what’s happening nearby soon” and
spontaneously join.
Instead of algorithmic personalisation, serendipity arises through infrastructural visibility—the system’s spatial
and temporal rhythms that let patterns self-organise. This design encourages participants to balance planning
with discovery, structure with openness.
4.1.4
Memory and After-life. Although the communities using Social Layer are temporary, their interactions
produce knowledge, relationships, and artifacts worth carrying forward. The system therefore can be seen as a
memory layer that preserves event histories, photos, notes, and participation traces as portable memories. These
archived traces form a connective tissue between pop-ups, enabling practices and relationships to travel into
future iterations.
This design supports not only co-presence but also after-presence—the lingering infrastructures of connection
that sustain collaboration beyond the lifespan of a single residency. Memories are community-owned, exportable,
and can seed the setup of future deployments, helping participants build continuity across ephemeral worlds.

Architecture and Interfaces
4.2.1
Coordinator Dashboard. The coordinator-facing interface provides configuration and infrastructural man-
agement capabilities. From the dashboard, community managers can define the parameters that shape collective
coordination (Fig. 3):
• Group and Event Settings — Coordinators can set global parameters such as time zone, event visibil-
ity, and participant permissions (e.g., who can create, join, or view events). These settings allow each
community to experiment with openness and self-governance.
• Programs and Venues — Events are grouped into Programs (e.g., thematic residencies) and attached to
Venues that represent physical or virtual spaces. Each venue includes editable metadata such as location,
description, capacity, amenities, availability windows, and opening hours. Coordinators can restrict venues
to specific programs or make them globally available.
• Permission and Role System — Facilitators, members, and participants can have distinct roles. These
roles determine which functions are accessible in a given context—allowing a single user to act as organiser
in one residency and as participant in another.
• Data Export and Transparency — Event and participation data can be exported, supporting community
ownership and further analysis. This functionality treats data not as proprietary but as a shared resource.
The dashboard thus constitutes the infrastructural layer of the social fabric—where boundaries, capacities, and
rhythms of visibility are collectively defined.
4.2.2
Participant Interface. The participant-facing interface emphasises immediacy, discovery, and serendipity.
Its structure supports fluid movement between planned and spontaneous participation (Fig. 4).
• Prominent Event Creation — A visible “Create Event” button anchors the interface. Participants can
initiate gatherings with minimal input (title, time, venue), lowering the threshold for contribution. Optional
modules allow hosts to add co-hosts, speakers, tickets, or tags, but these remain secondary.
• Event Schedule and Discovery — A unified schedule displays all ongoing and upcoming activities
across programs. Users can toggle between compact, list, venue, or weekly views. The schedule visualises
overlaps and temporal rhythms, supporting coordination through visibility rather than control.
• Filtering and Navigation — Events can be filtered by tag, venue, or program, enabling participants
to navigate thematic and spatial affinities while still being exposed to adjacent activities. The map
view provides a spatial view of ongoing and upcoming events across venues. Each event is geolocated,
supporting both navigation and serendipitous encounters.

Fig. 5. Shared Schedule and Map View from Solar Layer
• RSVP and Presence Cues — Participants can mark attendance or interest("star") without committing
fully. Hosts may optionally enable QR-based check-in. Presence indicators make participation visible
enough for coordination while maintaining the ambiguity conducive to informal joining.
• Badges and Tickets — Tickets can be configured as free or paid, with optional qualification badges
granting access or privileges. These symbolic elements support informal reputation and reciprocity within
the community.
Together, these features create a digital topology where structured programs coexist with improvisational
events, allowing planned and serendipitous gatherings to emerge side by side.
4.2.3
Shared Schedule and Spatial Coordination. The shared schedule acts as the system’s central coordination
surface. Each event is embedded within time and place, connecting the digital interface to the lived geography of
the pop-up city or residency. The schedule displays daily and weekly rhythms—yoga sessions, deep-work sprints,
talks, dinners—and makes them legible to all participants (Fig. 5).
By visualising temporal proximity and venue co-location, the schedule surfaces potential intersections: users
might notice overlapping sessions or nearby gatherings and decide to join spontaneously. This infrastructural
visibility replaces algorithmic recommendation with a collectively perceivable temporal map.

4.2.4
Configurability and Portability. All data and configurations are exportable for community member with
the permissions, allowing communities to migrate, fork, or recompose the system for future residencies. The
architecture treats each deployment as a version rather than an instance: communities can inherit prior structures
while reshaping them to local conditions. This supports continuity across temporary gatherings and builds an
evolving ecology of interconnected infrastructures.

Results: Diving into the Co-Livings of Pop-Up Cities with Social Layer
Through a research-through-design process, we examined how infrastructural design might scaffold serendipity
at the scale of temporary, intentional communities. Social Layer evolved from a speculative prototype into a
functioning socio-technical infrastructure adopted by multiple pop-up residencies. Each deployment tested how
lightweight coordination, visibility, and modular trust mechanisms could support the emergence of improvisational
order. Each deployment not only tested design hypotheses about serendipity and participation but also enacted
infrastructuring in practice—embedding the system into local contexts, governance patterns, and event ecologies.
5.1
Macro-level Observations Across Communities
Across its deployments, Social Layer has supported a diverse network of pop-up residencies and intentional
gatherings, including Shanhaiwoo 20238, muChiangmai 20239, Edge Esmeralda 202410, Aleph 2024 11, and Gathering
of Tribe 202412. These deployments ranged from week-long micro-residencies to month-long community exper-
iments, with participant communities ranging from roughly 100 to 800 members. Collectively, they served as
living laboratories for infrastructuring temporary social worlds—spaces where digital coordination tools, physical
proximity, and shared intent intersected to create ephemeral but socially dense collectives.
We summarize macro-level participation metrics across these deployments in Table 1.

Across all deployments, participants collectively hosted 1,586 events, of which 1,106 (69.7%) were self-organized
after the community had already begun. This high proportion indicates that spontaneous, member-driven activity
was not peripheral but central to how these temporary collectives evolved. As residents became familiar with
shared rhythms and infrastructures, they increasingly initiated their own gatherings, transforming the platform
from a coordination tool into a medium for emergent authorship.

Fig. 6. Moments in ShanHaiWoo
The intensity and form of self-organization varied considerably across sites. Gathering of Tribe demonstrated
an almost fully emergent mode, with 98% of its 364 events organized within a six-day period—an ecosystem of
serendipitous encounters arising from high temporal density. Shanhaiwoo similarly exhibited strong “bottom-
up” dynamism (95%), where informal dinners, discussions, and workshops continuously reconfigured social
connections. By contrast, muChiangmai and Aleph balanced structured programming with open-ended extensions
(41%), blending planned coordination with unplanned improvisation. Edge Esmeralda, showing how even large-
scale communities can sustain distributed, serendipity-driven creation once infrastructural conditions are in
place.
Across these contexts, serendipity operated less as random chance and more as an infrastructured affordance—a
pattern of social emergence enabled by lightweight tools for visibility, coordination, and invitation. The Social
Layer thus facilitated not merely participation but the continuous re-authoring of community life through
unplanned yet consequential encounters.
5.2
Micro-Level Observations: In Case of ShanHaiWoo 2023
Zooming in, ShanHaiWoo 2023 offers a rich view of micro-level affordances and social emergence. Held in
Beidahu, Jilin, over four weeks, the residency gathered around 100 participants from art, design, technology, and
regenerative culture. Over 120 events were recorded—many spontaneous, self-initiated, and socially contagious
through the platform’s one-click event creation.(Fig. 6).
“Social Layer made it effortless to start something—it removed permission, roles, and the need for
approval.”(P1)
“It was a social-technical system that amplified individual agency—turning a personal spark into
collective action.”(P2)
“It’s not the tool that created results—it simply set the condition for serendipity out of chaos.”(P3)
From the analysis of field notes and participant reflections, five intertwined patterns emerged.
5.2.1
Emergent Self-Organization and Collective Rhythm. Participants described a dynamic equilibrium between
freedom and coherence—a boundary that felt both free and safe. Through minimal scaffolding (shared calendar,
chat channel, physical notice board), self-organization flourished:

Infrastructuring Pop-Up Cities with “Social Layer”
•
11
“After the first unconference, spontaneous events filled every hour until everyone was exhausted.” (P5)
“People from different disciplines came together and self-organized activities—there was never a
shortage of ideas.” (P4)
The infrastructural visibility of others’ actions created temporal rhythm: morning yoga, afternoon unconfer-
ences, late-night bonfires—all loosely synchronized yet emergent.
5.2.2
Playful Improvisation and Situated Making. Spontaneous play and experimentation became social bonding
rituals.
“A group of not-so-outdoorsy people spent an hour putting up four tents, held the first ‘mountain
assembly,’ and welcomed newcomers through a face-to-face onboarding ritual.” (P7)
“While playing around, we learned new things, and while learning, new ideas emerged.” (P9)
Improvisation was central—not as deviation but as situated making: acting in context with others to shape
shared meanings and material conditions.
5.2.3
Amplified Agency and UGC-Style Participation.
“Within three days we launched a Women Coding Camp—friends who were just chatting the day
before suddenly became mentors.” (P15)
The system’s low-friction creation mechanism transformed passive attendance into user-generated culture
(UGC). Participants internalized a permissionless ethos: “anyone can host,” leading to a cascade of peer-driven
initiatives that blurred the line between organizer and participant.
5.2.4
Real Encounters and Social Trust.
“On a hike, we could trace an idea from its spark to realization—through intimate, one-to-one ex-
changes.” (P12)
“Shared meals became the seed for an on-chain art game.” (P11)
Physical co-presence intertwined with digital visibility, fostering trust through encounter. Serendipitous
proximity—seeing others’ open events and joining spontaneously—enabled deeper relational bonds than planned
networking could achieve.
5.2.5
World-Building and Collective Imagination.
“In just a few days, the snowfield turned into a miniature world—a place of collisions and surprises.”
(P16)
“People took on roles—mountain dwellers, sea dwellers, spirit beasts. The only way to ‘level up’ was by
contributing to the story itself.” (P13)
Participants collectively world-built a symbolic narrative that connected diverse activities into a shared
imaginary. The Social Layer’s open architecture supported these evolving fictions, letting stories, rituals, and
identities emerge from within.
5.2.6
Mini Case: Counting Rice. A defining micro-level example of serendipity in action was the event Counting
Rice, spontaneously initiated by a participant (P1) during ShanHaiWoo 2023(Fig. 7).
The event occurred in a small, sunlit office space on the Shanhaiwoo residency site. P1 placed a event notice
on Social Layer interface allowed participants to see the event immediately, RSVP, and join without any formal
permission or approval. Within minutes, eight participants gathered, each approaching the task differently—some
meticulously arranging grains into strict grids, others experimenting with diagonal patterns or playful abstractions.
Participants described a mixture of curiosity, amusement, and focused engagement:

Danwen Ji and Botao ‘Amber’ Hu
Fig. 7. Improvisational Event: Counting Rice
“I didn’t know why I was doing it, but it felt like a small rebellion against usual productivity. Each
grain was like a tiny decision, and together, we created a collective rhythm.” (P8)
“It was utterly meaningless, yet deeply absorbing. The room felt like a shared mental playground,
where everyone’s small actions influenced the emergent whole.” (P6)
Participants later reflected that the event would likely never occur in a traditional structured setting:
“It felt useless but fun. I cannot imagine it happening anywhere else. The fact that I could just start
something—without asking anyone—made me feel I could shape this place.” (P2)
“These micro-rituals made the residency alive. You could sense things forming—like small gravitational
fields—around spontaneous gatherings.” (P4)
Through Counting Rice, we see how low-friction tools, visible cues, and an open social architecture coalesced
to create an emergent, playful, and socially meaningful experience. The event exemplifies how infrastructuring
conditions can transform trivial or absurd actions into rich, serendipitous interactions that enhance trust,
collaboration, and creative exploration.

Infrastructuring Serendipitious Co-living
Across these deployments, Social Layer’s infrastructural affordances—visible participation cues, frictionless
event creation, and flexible boundary modules—enabled serendipity not by prescribing it, but by sustaining
conditions for its emergence. In this sense, the system did not ‘cause’ spontaneous encounters, but made them
infrastructurally possible at community scale. The following section synthesizes these insights as design patterns
for future improvisational infrastructures.

Discussion
6.1
Scaffolded Spontaneity: Improvisational Infrastructures at the Edge of Chaos
We articulate scaffolded spontaneity as a strong concept to describe how infrastructures can be designed as sets
of affordances that invite improvisation rather than prescribe programmes. In our account, scaffolded spontaneity
refers to infrastructural conditions that make it easy, safe, and legible for participants to initiate and recombine

activities, while keeping the collective near the “edge of chaos” rather than in full order or entropy [Holland
2003; Kauffman 1993].
Social Layer operationalises this concept through concrete affordances: a prominent “Create Event” button with
ultra-minimal schema (“what, where, when”), a shared schedule and map view that render all activities co-visible
in time and space, lightweight RSVP and presence cues, and flexible boundary and role settings that treat rules as
editable rather than hard-coded. These structures do not dictate content; they signal how to start something and
where it might fit. Participants explicitly linked these affordances to their sense of agency: Social Layer “made it
effortless to start something—it removed permission, roles, and the need for approval,” and “amplified individual
agency—turning a personal spark into collective action.”
Our macro-level findings show how these affordances scaled. Across five deployments, 69.7% of 1,586 events
were self-organized, with Shanhaiwoo and Gathering of Tribe reaching 95–98% member-initiated events within
highly compressed timeframes. Micro-cases such as Counting Rice—an ostensibly "useless" but "artsy" activity that
quickly gathered eight participants into an absorbing shared experiment—demonstrate how low-friction initiation,
shared visibility, and open invitations can turn trivial sparks into collective improvisation and world-building.
Design-wise, scaffolded spontaneity foregrounds calibrated friction as a key lever. Requiring every event
to have a host, time, and place, and to appear on a common schedule, introduced “just enough” friction to
prevent collapse into noise, while keeping initiation near zero-cost. Treating user-initiated actions as first-class
interactions, instrumenting shared rhythms (meals, unconference slots, rituals), and allowing communities to
tune rules over time together compose a repertoire of affordances through which improvisational infrastructures
can be designed, tested, and iterated in pop-up cities.
6.2
Serendipitous Criticality: Weak-Tie Bridging in Temporary Co-living
Our findings reinforce social theory about the strength of weak ties [Granovetter 1973] and illustrate how
technology can facilitate weak-tie interaction in temporary physical communities. Traditional community design
often focuses on strengthening bonds among members (bonding capital), but bridging capital – connecting
across diverse groups – is equally vital for innovation and learning [Burt 2004]. Social Layer’s design patterns
(open invitations, visibility of others’ interests, prompt to “see what’s happening nearby”) intentionally surface
opportunities for people to step outside their usual circles. We observed that this led to many cross-pollinating
encounters that participants valued. For design researchers, this suggests designing “bridge prompts” – features
that gently encourage interaction between otherwise unconnected subgroups. Examples might include high-
lighting events that draw mixed attendance, or suggesting collaborative activities that span disciplines. The
key is that these are not personalized recommendations (“You and X should meet”), but rather environmental
nudges (like public postings of activities) that rely on human initiative to bridge. This respects individual agency
and avoids over-curation, aligning with philosophy that serendipity cannot be forced, only invited [André et al.
2009; Björneborn 2017]. In sum, surfacing weak-tie opportunities should be a design goal for systems aiming to
enhance community serendipity. The benefits are improved creativity, faster dissemination of ideas, and a more
inclusive social mesh, as newcomers or peripheral members find entry points to engage.
6.3
Limitations and Future Work
While our findings are encouraging about the role of digital infrastructure in fostering serendipitous co-living,
there are important limitations and open questions. First, our data relied on cases that were all somewhat aligned
in ethos – these were communities predisposed to openness and tech friendliness. We do not know how Social
Layer would fare in a community with more resistant culture or where digital tools are viewed skeptically. Future
work could deploy similar systems in more varied contexts, or even in corporate innovation workshops, to test
generality.

Second, we did not conduct systematic post-hoc interviews in this study (to avoid overburdening participants
who already had reflection rituals). Our insights come from observations and voluntary feedback. A more
structured evaluation (e.g., measuring social network change or surveying perceived serendipity) would strengthen
the evidence. We plan to complement this with trace ethnography and interviews in upcoming deployments to
assess long-term outcomes: e.g., did people form collaborations that persisted months later? How inclusive was
the spontaneity – did everyone feel equally empowered to host, or did subtle hierarchies remain (like language
barriers, etc.)? These questions touch on inclusion and well-being, which are vital if such infrastructures are to
be heralded as socially beneficial.
A tension worth exploring is scaling and overload. In Edge Esmeralda (580 people), some reported feeling
overwhelmed by the sheer number of events (hundreds in 4 weeks). Serendipity can have a paradox: too many
choices might lead to decision fatigue or fragmentation of community (everyone in their niche micro-events).
Designing interfaces that help surface relevant serendipity without overwhelming is an open challenge. We
consciously avoided heavy recommendation, but maybe gentle personalization could help in larger settings
(while still preserving transparency). There’s space for research on how to balance discovery and focus, perhaps
through better visualization or community moderation (Edge Esmeralda introduced a daily digest meeting to
highlight certain events).

Conclusion
Pop-up cities are a distinct socio-technical form: longer than conferences, shorter than degrees; more structured
than everyday urban anonymity yet less scripted than academic programs. By analyzing the design and deploy-
ment of Social Layer across multiple communities, we articulated “scaffolded spontaneity” and documented
infrastructuring moves that enable serendipity while maintaining trust, rhythms, and care. Our account bridges
CSCW/STS notions of infrastructuring and boundary objects with HCI concerns about social translucence and
with urban studies on temporary urbanism. Future work will combine in-depth interviews with trace ethnography
to evaluate how these infrastructures shape inclusion, well-being, and long-term collaboration—so that temporary
cities can be both playful and profound.
