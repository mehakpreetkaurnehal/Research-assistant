ABSTRACT
Context. Runaway stars depart their birthplaces with high peculiar velocities. Two mechanisms are commonly invoked to explain
their origin, the binary supernova scenario (BSS) and the dynamical ejection scenario (DES). Investigating the kinematic properties
of runaway stars is key to understanding their origins.
Aims. We intend to investigate the origins of 39 B-type runaway stars from LAMOST using orbital traceback analysis.
Methods. From the catalog of LAMOST, we selected 39 B-type runaway stars and determined their spectral subtypes from key ab-
sorption lines. We then derived atmospheric parameters for each star using the Stellar Label Machine (SLAM), which is trained on
TLUSTY synthetic spectra computed under the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) assumption. Using the derived atmo-
spheric parameters as input, we estimated stellar masses and ages with a machine learning model trained on PARSEC evolutionary
tracks. We finally performed orbital traceback with GALPY to analyze their origins.
Results. Through orbital traceback, we find that 29 stars have trajectories entirely within the Galactic disk, whereas 10 are disk-
passing yet still trace back to the disk. Two stars have trajectories that intersect those of known clusters. Their orbits show similar
morphologies in both the X−Y and R−Z planes, and their [M/H] values are comparable, suggesting possible cluster origins. However,
definitive confirmation will require additional evidence. In addition, the VSp −v sin i plane shows that runaway stars with low peculiar
space velocities but high v sin i remain on the Galactic disk, whereas those with high peculiar space velocities but low v sin i pass
through the disk, possibly reflecting two distinct origins.

1. Introduction
Runaway stars rapidly depart from their natal clusters or associ-
ations, typically exhibiting peculiar velocities of about 30 −40
km −1 (Blaauw & Morgan 1954; Gies & Bolton 1986; Hoogerw-
erf et al. 2000). Most observed runaway stars are massive early-
type stars, with over 30% of O stars and approximately 5−10%
of B stars considered to be runaway stars (Blaauw 1961; Stone
1979; Mdzinarishvili & Chargeishvili 2005; Carretero-Castrillo
et al. 2023). While most runaway studies have focused on OB
stars, cooler runaway stars such as A/F-type candidates have
also been reported in the Milky Way and in the 30 Doradus re-
gion of the LMC (Maíz Apellániz et al. 2018; Teklehaimanot &
Gebrehiwot 2024). Furthermore, more than half of the massive
runaway stars exhibit enhanced surface helium abundances and
rapid rotation (Cassinelli & Churchwell 1993; Hoogerwerf et al.
2000).
Two formation scenarios have been proposed to explain their
origin. One is the binary supernova scenario (BSS), first pro-
posed by Zwicky (1957) and later developed by Blaauw (1961),
in which the more massive component of a binary first under-
goes core collapse, leaving behind a compact object (a neutron
star or black hole). If the supernova ejects more than half of the
system’s total mass or imparts a significant natal kick to the rem-
nant, the surviving companion is likely to become a runaway star
(Renzo et al. 2019). Otherwise, if the system remains bound, the
companion and compact object may form a runaway binary, po-
tentially observable as a high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) (van
den Heuvel et al. 2000). The other channel is the dynamical ejec-
tion scenario (DES; Poveda et al. 1967), in which early–type
runaway stars are ejected from dense clusters or associations
through gravitational interactions. Among these ejection mecha-
nisms, binary–binary interactions are more efficient than binary–
single star encounters (Hoffer 1983). Both scenarios are believed
to occur, but their relative efficiencies have been debated for the
past few decades (Sana et al. 2022; Chen et al. 2025).
Runaway stars formed via DES and BSS can be distin-
guished in several ways. One common method involves trac-
ing back the kinematic trajectories of runaway stars to their
parent clusters, which is widely used to identify runaway stars
originating from the DES (Blaauw & Morgan 1954; Gies &
Bolton 1986; Hoogerwerf et al. 2001). The chemical composi-
tion also provides valuable information. Although runaway stars
from both formation scenarios typically retain their initial chem-
ical abundances (McEvoy et al. 2017), supernova explosions in
binary systems may result in α element enrichment in ejected
stars (Przybilla et al. 2008; Irrgang et al. 2010). In addition, DES
runaways typically have higher space velocities than BSS ones,

while runaways with high v sin i are thought to arise mainly from
BSS (Sana et al. 2022).
The recent availability of extensive spectroscopic data from
the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope
(LAMOST) has provided an opportunity to investigate the ori-
gin of runaway stars (Cui et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2012; Deng
et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2020). Recently, Guo et al. (2024) iden-
tified 547 runaway stars from LAMOST Data Release 8 (DR8)
and analyzed their statistical properties. Based on that catalog,
Chen et al. (2025) investigated their binary fractions and eval-
uated the relative contributions of the BSS and DES formation
scenarios. In this work, we perform orbital traceback analysis for
39 B-type runaway stars from the sample identified by Guo et al.
(2024) to investigate their origins.
The structure of this paper is as follows. We introduce the
LAMOST data in Section 2. Section 3 presents the subclassi-
fication of the sample and the methods used to estimate its at-
mospheric and fundamental parameters Kinematic analyses and
the corresponding results are presented in Section 4. Finally, our
conclusions are summarized in Section 5.
2. Data
The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Tele-
scope (LAMOST) is a 4-meter quasi-meridian reflecting
Schmidt telescope located at the Xinglong station of the National
Astronomical Observatories, China. The focal plane of the tele-
scope offers a 5-degree field of view and can accommodate up to
4,000 fibers (Cui et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2012; Deng et al. 2012).
Since 2012, LAMOST has conducted a Low-Resolution Spec-
troscopic (LRS) survey with a resolving power of R ∼1800 and
a wavelength coverage of 3690 ∼9100 Å (Deng et al. 2012). In
October 2018, LAMOST began a five-year Medium-Resolution
Spectroscopic (MRS) survey aimed at conducting time-domain
observations of objects in the Galactic region. The MRS spec-
tra are captured with blue and red cameras, covering wavelength
ranges of 4950 ∼5350 Å and 6300 ∼6800 Å , respectively (Liu
et al. 2020).
By combining LAMOST DR8 radial velocities with Gaia
DR3 astrometry, Guo et al. (2024) determined the peculiar tan-
gential, radial, and space velocities of 4,432 early-type stars. Fol-
lowing the approach of Berger & Gies (2001) and Wang et al.
(2022), we identified 229 runaway stars with peculiar space ve-
locities exceeding 43 km s−1, corresponding to approximately
1% of the peak of the fitted Maxwellian distribution of the space
velocities. In addition, 480 further runaway candidates were se-
lected based on their peculiar tangential velocities exceeding 33
km s−1, corresponding to approximately 1% of the peak of the
fitted Maxwellian distribution of the tangential velocities. Be-
cause 162 sources are common to both subsamples, the final cat-
alog comprises 547 runaway stars.
From this catalog, we select 46 B-type runaway stars and de-
termine their kinematic origins using orbital traceback. Although
many studies restrict the definition of B stars to the B3–B9
range, we adopt the broader B0V–B9V range, since our sam-
ple also includes three B2-type stars. The Gaia DR3 parallaxes
as a function of G magnitude for the 46 runaway stars are shown
in Figure 1. Most objects are concentrated between G = 10 and
13 mag. Only four stars have G < 10 mag, two of which are
at G = 9.94 mag, while the other two are somewhat brighter
(G = 9.3 and G = 8.9 mag). In general, the magnitude distribu-
tion of our sample is nearly homogeneous.
We note that some objects within the OB temperature range
could, in principle, be contaminated by blue horizontal branch
(BHB) stars, as both populations exhibit similar surface gravi-
ties (Xue et al. 2008; Catelan 2009; Salgado et al. 2013; Guo
et al. 2025). To assess this, we cross-matched our sample with
the LAMOST BHB catalog (Vickers et al. 2021; Ju et al. 2024)
and several other major BHB catalogs (Beers et al. 2007; Xue
et al. 2008; Brown et al. 2008; Culpan et al. 2021), and found
one overlapping source. This star has been removed from the fi-
nal sample to avoid potential contamination, leaving 45 stars for
further analysis.
3. Method
3.1. Spectral classification
To obtain more precise atmospheric parameters, we cross-
matched the 547 early-type star candidates with the LAMOST
LRS DR10 and identified 123 matches. Because our analysis fo-
cuses on B-type runaway stars, we performed spectral subclassi-
fication of these spectra through visual inspection, following the
MKCLASS-based criteria established for LAMOST OB stars by
Liu et al. (2019) (see their Table 2).
The classification criteria are summarized as follows: For B-
type stars, the strengths of hydrogen Balmer lines (such as Hδ
and Hγ) increase from spectral types B0 to B9. The neutral he-
lium lines (He i 4026, 4121, 4471, 4713 Å) first strengthen and
then weaken, reaching a maximum intensity at B2 V. In con-
trast, the high-excitation Mg ii 4481 Å line gradually strengthens
throughout the B-type sequence. When this trend is not clearly
visible, we also rely on specific absorption lines and line ratios
as auxiliary criteria. For stars of types B2 to B9, the ratio of He i
4471 to Mg ii 4481 generally decreases (Gray & Corbally 2009;
Liu et al. 2019). Furthermore, for stars of the same spectral type,
the strengths of the hydrogen Balmer lines generally decrease
with luminosity from the main sequence to supergiants.
Based on these classification criteria and the LAMOST-LRS
spectra1 from the LAMOST archive, we have determined the
spectral types for 45 B-type runaway stars, which are listed
in Column 9 of Table A.1. Figure 2 shows the spectra of five
representative B-type stars (B3 to B9) in the wavelength range
of 3900–4750 Å, with some important spectral feature lines
marked.
3.2. Atmospheric parameters
With the spectral subtypes established above, we derive at-
mospheric parameters for our B-type runaway stars, includ-
ing effective temperature (Teff), surface gravity (log g), metal-
licity ([M/H]) and rotational velocity (v sin i), using the Stellar
Label Machine (SLAM; Guo et al. 2021), a data-driven for-
ward spectral model based on support vector regression (SVR)
(Zhang et al. 2020). It utilizes a training dataset constructed from
TLUSTY synthetic spectra derived based on non-local thermo-
dynamic equilibrium (NLTE) assumption (Zhang et al. 2020).
The low-resolution spectra from LAMOST offered broad wave-
length coverage, enabling better constraints on Teff, log g, and
[M/H]. On the other hand, medium-resolution spectra (MRS)
provided superior rotational velocity (v sin i) estimations due to
higher resolution and detailed line profiles (Guo et al. 2021).
Therefore, the values of Teff, log g, and [M/H] were derived from
LRS spectra, while v sin i was calculated from MRS spectra. The
typical uncertainties for LAMOST MRS are σ(Teff) = 2, 185
1 We used the python package laspec from https://github.com/
hypergravity/laspec to normalize the spectra using a spline fit.

K, σ(V sin i) = 11 km s−1 and σ(log g) = 0.29 cm s−2, while
for LAMOST LRS are σ(Teff) = 1, 642 K, σ(V sin i) = 42 km
s−1 and σ(log g) = 0.25 cm s−2 (Guo et al. 2021). We omit-
ted the broad diffuse interstellar bands of 4430, 5780, 6196,
6283, and 6614 Å (Herbig 1995; Guo et al. 2021). We provide
two examples from our sample, illustrating the observed spectra
(black lines) along with the corresponding best-fitting spectra
(red dashed lines) derived using SLAM.
However, because the NLTE TLUSTY grid has a lower tem-
perature bound of 15,000 K, using SLAM below this limit would
involve extrapolation, which may introduce biases. In contrast,
Xiang et al. (2022) provide LTE atmospheric parameters based
on ATLAS12 over 7,500–60,000 K, so the 9,000–15,000 K
regime of our sample lies within their trained range, making
those estimates more reliable (i.e., interpolation rather than ex-
trapolation). Although NLTE effects are significant for early-
type stars (Lanz & Hubeny 2007), an analysis of LAMOST LRS
spectra by Xiang et al. (2022) shows that, for temperatures be-
low 25,000 K, LTE and NLTE determinations are in good agree-
ment. Accordingly, for stars in our sample with Teff ≥15, 000 K,
atmospheric parameters were derived using SLAM, while for
those with Teff < 15, 000 K, we adopted the parameters provided
by Xiang et al. (2022). The derived atmospheric parameters are
listed in Table A.1.
3.3. Physical parameters
Using the atmospheric parameters obtained above, we derived
the fundamental parameters, including masses and ages, for our
sample following the method described by Li et al. (2025). This
method employs a machine learning model implemented as a
random-forest (RF) regression algorithm, which iteratively pre-
dicts stellar luminosity, mass and age based on atmospheric pa-
rameters. RF regression is an ensemble method that pools the
outputs of thousands of decision trees, each grown on a random
subset of the training sample, to yield a single, robust prediction.
When the atmospheric parameters are fed in, every decision tree
makes its own prediction, and the RF then averages them to ob-
tain the final value. This averaging dampens the idiosyncrasies
of single trees, cutting variance and yielding stable, accurate re-
sults even when the underlying relations are noisy or highly non-
linear (Li et al. 2025).
We used main-sequence stars extracted from the PARSEC
1.2S (Bressan et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2014; Fu et al. 2018) as the
training grid for the RF algorithm. The training grid comprises
a grid of stellar parameters covering 7000K < Teff < 49,000 K,
0.55 < log g < 4.52 dex, and −0.6 < [M/H] < 0.6 dex. The
process begins with the prediction of luminosity using Teff, log g
and [M/H]. This predicted luminosity, along with Teff, log g and
[M/H], is then used to predict stellar mass. Finally, the model
predicts stellar age based on Teff, log g, [M/H], as well as the pre-
viously derived luminosity and mass. Validation of the method
shows that the uncertainty of mass prediction is 9%, whereas the

Fig. 3. Training grid and predicted sample in the log g–Teff plane. The
background shows the PARSEC 1.2S main-sequence grid color-coded
by stellar mass. The black crosses and triangles represent our 45 B-type
runaway stars, with colors corresponding to their predicted masses us-
ing the same color scale. Crosses denote stars lying within the parameter
range of the training grid (high certainty), while triangles indicate ex-
trapolated sources outside the grid (low certainty).
age dispersion is 0.44 Gyr. The larger dispersion in age predic-
tion arises from poorly constrained metallicity in early-type stars
and the inherent age–metallicity degeneracy.
The derived masses and ages are presented in Tab A.1. Fig-
ure 3 illustrates the PARSEC1.2S training grid in the log g–Teff
plane, color-coded by stellar mass. Our predicted sources are
overplotted as black symbols using the same mass color scale.
Crosses mark stars located within the training grid (“high cer-
tainty”), whereas triangles correspond to extrapolated objects
outside the grid (“low certainty”). These two cases are also
flagged as “I” (inside) and “O” (outside) in TableA.1. From the
figure, six stars are found to lie outside the training grid — one
of them have Teff and log g within the grid boundaries but fall
outside in [M/H]. Since the RF model extrapolates for these out-
of-range inputs, their predicted masses and ages are deemed un-
reliable, and sources marked with a triangle are also considered
to lie outside the main-sequence phase. Four of these outliers
exhibit unusually high inferred masses (> 16M⊙), further sup-
porting their exclusion. Therefore, we removed these six stars
from the subsequent analysis, resulting in a final sample of 39
B-type runaway stars.
3.4. Orbital trajectories
Having derived the atmospheric and fundamental parameters, we
use the Python package GALPY (Bovy 2015) to calculate the
Galactic trajectories of our stars. Proper motions were retrieved
from Gaia EDR3 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021), and distances
were obtained from the posterior distribution of geometric dis-
tances by Bailer-Jones et al. (2021), while radial velocities and
peculiar space velocities (VSp) were taken from Guo et al. (2024).
We adopt the solar motion of (U⊙,V⊙,W⊙) = (11.10, 12.24, 7.25)
km s−1 from Schönrich et al. (2010), the solar Galactocentric dis-
tance R0 = 8.5 kpc, and the circular Galactic rotational velocity
Vc = 220 km s−1 from Kerr & Lynden-Bell (1986) (see Guo et al.
(2024)). We determined the uncertainties in the birthplaces of the
39 stars by conducting Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, assuming
Gaussian error distributions for distances, proper motions, radial
velocities, and ages (Liu et al. 2023).
4. Results
4.1. Orbital trajectories of stars
Although the Milky Way’s disk flare and warp cause the ex-
ponential scaleheight to increase with Galactocentric radius, re-
ported values vary among studies because they use different pop-
ulations and methods (López-Corredoira & Molgó 2014; Wang
et al. 2018a; Yu et al. 2021). Based on LAMOST DR5 OB stars,
Yu et al. (2021) derived a scaleheight increasing from 0.14 to 0.5
kpc over R=8–14 kpc, similar to the thin disk values reported
by Wang et al. (2018a). For the thick disk, López-Corredoira &
Molgó (2014) and Wang et al. (2018b) reported scaleheights of
0.5–1.5 kpc over R=8–20 kpc. Considering the different scale
heights of the thin and thick disks, and the R distribution of our
sample, we adopt |Z|=0.5 kpc2 as the threshold to distinguish
disk objects (Liu et al. 2023). Notably, there is no rigid border
orthogonal to the Galactic disk, and in a disk population with a
given scale height, about 30% of the stars may extend beyond
that height.
After computing the Galactic orbits of our stars, we present
the trajectories for four example stars in Figures 4 and 5, shown
in the Galactic X −Y and R −Z planes, with the color bar in-
dicating travel time (Myr), defined here as the elapsed time for
a star to move from its birthplace to its current position. Red
markers denote the birthplaces of the stars, black crosses indi-
cate their current positions, and the red-shaded contours outline
the uncertainties in the birth locations derived from Monte Carlo
simulations. Fig. 4 shows two examples of stars for which there
is no significant change between their current locations and their
birthplaces and their orbits remain confined within |Z| < 0.5 kpc,
supporting a disk origin. In total, 29 stars exhibit this behavior.
In the top panel of Fig. 5, although the trajectories pass through
the disk, the birthplaces of stars can still be traced back to within
|Z| < 0.5 kpc, and 9 stars in our sample fall into this category. No-
tably, we use the term “pass through the disk” (also referred to as
“disk-passing” hereafter) to describe stars whose orbits pass the
Galactic disk region (as defined here as being within |Z|<=0.5
kpc), which may involve passing through and leaving the disk,
or possibly returning to it at a later time. In the bottom panel of
Fig. 5, the birthplace of this star is closer to the disk edge, but af-
ter considering the MC uncertainties, they can still be regarded
as having a disk origin. We have one such sources in total. In
summary, 29 stars have trajectories entirely confined within the
disk, while 10 stars have trajectories that pass through the disk
but may still be considered to have a disk origin.
4.2. Possible Cluster Origin
To investigate potential dynamical ejection scenarios (DES),
we cross-matched our sample of 39 stars with cluster catalogs
(Castro-Ginard et al. 2019, 2020; Hunt & Reffert 2023) and
found that the trajectories of only two sources intersect with
those of clusters. We also use the Python package GALPY (Bovy
2015) to calculate the Galactic trajectories for the two matched
clusters and show the resluts in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7.
2 We also tested a smaller boundary of |Z| = 0.14 kpc and found that,
when considering the uncertainties in the birth positions, all of our stars
still originate from within the Galactic disk.

Fig. 4. Orbital trajectories for two example stars with coordinates RA: 57.671321, Dec: 57.178426 (top panels) and RA: 41.448800, Dec:
54.544701 (bottom panels), shown in the Galactic X −Y plane (left panels) and the Galactic R −Z plane (right panels). The color scale indi-
cates travel time (Myr), with the red star marking each star’s birthplace and the black “x” marking its current position. The red-shaded contours
denote the uncertainty regions of the birthplaces.
Fig. 6 displays the orbital trajectories of a star with RA =
102.2630, Dec = 41.9814 and its matched cluster IC 1311. The
left panel shows the Galactic X–Y projection and the right panel
shows the Galactic R–Z projection in Galactic coordinates. The
red star and red circle indicate the birthplaces of the star and clus-
ter, while the black cross and black circle mark their present-day
positions. Colorbars show the look-back time along each orbit.
The star has Teff = 10,339 K, log g = 3.65, and [M/H] = –0.48,
while the metallicity of IC 1311 is [M/H] = –0.30 ± 0.16 as re-
ported by Warren & Cole (2009). In the Galactic X −Y plane,
both the star and the cluster move counterclockwise, while in the
R −Z plane their trajectories broadly overlap. The similarity be-
tween their orbital trajectories and metallicities suggests that the
star may have originated from the cluster.
Fig.7 displays the orbital trajectories of a star with RA =
41.4488, Dec = 54.5447 and its matched cluster NGC 2236. The
left panel shows the Galactic X–Y projection and the right panel
shows the Galactic R–Z projection in Galactic coordinates, re-
spectively. The marking scheme is the same as in Fig.6. The
star has Teff = 9,890 K, log g = 3.87, and [M/H] = –0.28. The
metallicity of NGC 2236 is [M/H] = –0.19 ± 0.08 as reported by
Zhong et al. (2020). The orbital trajectories in Fig. 7 show that
the star was initially close to NGC 2236, but later moved away
from the cluster’s orbit in the R–Z projection. This suggests that
the star may have been ejected from the cluster. Notably, defini-
tive confirmation would require further evidence. As noted by
Hoogerwerf et al. (2001), compelling evidence for the dynam-
ical ejection scenario (DES) involves finding a common site of
origin for the individual components of the encounter.
4.3. Statistical properties

v sin i plane. Black dots denote disk-confined runaways (orbits
confined to the Galactic disk), whereas red stars mark disk-
passing runaways. Cyan squares denote runaway stars that may
share a common origin with the cluster. The dashed lines at
v sin i = 61 km s−1 and VSp = 126 km s−1 correspond to the 3σ
thresholds derived from Maxwellian fits to the respective distri-
butions (Sec. 4.3 of Guo et al. (2024)).
Figure 8 indicates that the majority of B-type runaways lie
in the gray region, corresponding to low peculiar space veloc-
ities and low v sin i. The disk-confined subsample (black dots)
has relatively low peculiar space velocities and spans a wide
range of v sin i, whereas the disk-passing subsample (red stars)
tends to have higher VSp while maintaining low v sin i. Accord-
ing to Sana et al. (2022), slow-moving, rapidly rotating runaways
point to BSS, while fast-moving, slowly rotating runaways are
more consistent with DES. Rapidly rotating runaway stars are
interpreted as products of close binary interactions, such as stel-

Fig. 8. Distribution of runaway stars in the VSp −v sin i plane. Stars with
orbits remaining within the Galactic disk are marked as black dots, those
with disk-passing orbits are shown as red stars, and possible cluster-
origin runaways are depicted as cyan squares. Thresholds of v sin i = 61

tained from Maxwellian fits to the observed distributions, as described

lar mergers (Podsiadlowski et al. 1992; Tylenda et al. 2011) or
mass transfer (Packet 1981; Petrovic et al. 2005), which can
significantly increase the rotational velocity (Sana et al. 2022).
By contrast, DES involves close multi-body encounters that im-
part large VSp without significantly spinning up the ejected stars
(Sana et al. 2022). In addition, stars with a possible BSS ori-
gin tend to be disk-confined, whereas those with a possible DES
origin are disk-passing. While our orbital traceback provides sta-
tistical support for these trends, more definitive conclusions will
require high-resolution spectroscopic data in future work.
5. Summary
Runaway stars rapidly escape from their birth clusters or asso-
ciations, typically with peculiar velocities of 30–40 km/s. Two
mechanisms are typically considered, the binary supernova sce-
nario and the dynamical ejection scenario, but their relative con-
tributions remain uncertain. Determining the origins of runaways
may provide constraints on binary evolution and dynamical pro-
cesses.
In this work, we investigate the kinematic origins of 39 B–
type runaway stars identified by Guo et al. (2024). We deter-
mined spectral subclasses from key absorption lines and derived
atmospheric parameters with SLAM. We then estimated funda-
mental parameters using a machine learning model trained on
these parameters. Using GALPY, we compute each star’s Galac-
tic trajectory and find that 29 stars remain fully confined to the
disk, while 10 have disk-passing orbits yet still trace back to it.
Two of these may be consistent with a cluster origin, although
definitive confirmation would require further evidence. We also
find a feature in the VSp −v sin i plane: low-VSp, high-v sin i run-
aways are typically disk-confined, whereas high-VSp, low-v sin i
runaways are disk-passing, probably reflecting two different ori-
gins. This may provide new kinematic evidence to distinguish
between the binary supernova and dynamical ejection scenar-
ios. However, our conclusions are limited by the lack of high-
resolution spectroscopic abundances. Future surveys with higher
precision spectroscopy will be crucial to establish firmer con-
straints on the origins of runaway stars and their role in binary
evolution and cluster dynamics.
