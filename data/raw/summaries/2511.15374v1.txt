The investigation of legal judgment prediction (LJP), such as sentencing prediction, has attracted broad attention for its potential to promote judicial fairness, making the accuracy and reliability of its computation result an increasingly critical concern. In view of this, we present a new sentencing model that shares both legal logic interpretability and strong prediction capability by introducing a two-stage learning algorithm. Specifically, we first construct a hybrid model that synthesizes a mechanism model based on the main factors for sentencing with a neural network modeling possible uncertain features. We then propose a two-stage learning algorithm: First, an adaptive stochastic gradient (ASG) algorithm is used to get good estimates for the unknown parameters in the mechanistic component of the hybrid model. Then, the Adam optimizer tunes all parameters to enhance the predictive performance of the entire hybrid model. The asymptotic convergence of the ASG-based adaptive predictor is established without requiring any excitation data conditions, thereby providing a good initial parameter estimate for prediction. Based on this, the fast-converging Adam optimizer further refines the parameters to enhance overall prediction accuracy. Experiments on a real-world dataset of intentional injury cases in China show that our new hybrid model combined with our two-stage ASG-Adam algorithm, outperforms the existing related methods in sentencing prediction performance, including those based on neural networks and saturated mechanism models.
