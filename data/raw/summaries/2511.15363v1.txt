Efficiently encoding classical visual data into quantum states is essential for realizing practical quantum neural networks (QNNs). However, existing encoding schemes often discard spatial and semantic information when adapting high-dimensional images to the limited qubits of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. We propose a Fidelity-Preserving Quantum Encoding (FPQE) framework that performs near lossless data compression and quantum encoding. FPQE employs a convolutional encoder-decoder to learn compact multi-channel representations capable of reconstructing the original data with high fidelity, which are then mapped into quantum states through amplitude encoding. Experimental results show that FPQE performs comparably to conventional methods on simple datasets such as MNIST, while achieving clear improvements on more complex ones, outperforming PCA and pruning based encodings by up to 10.2\% accuracy on Cifar-10. The performance gain grows with data complexity, demonstrating FPQE's ability to preserve high-level structural information across diverse visual domains. By maintaining fidelity during classical to quantum transformation, FPQE establishes a scalable and hardware efficient foundation for high-quality quantum representation learning.
