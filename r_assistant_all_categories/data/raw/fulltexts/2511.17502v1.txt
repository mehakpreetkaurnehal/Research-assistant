We introduce RynnVLA-002, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and world model. The world
model leverages action and visual inputs to predict future image states, learning the underlying physics
of the environment to refine action generation. Conversely, the VLA model produces subsequent
actions from image observations, enhancing visual understanding and supporting the world model’s
image generation. The unified framework of RynnVLA-002 enables joint learning of environmental
dynamics and action planning. Our experiments show that RynnVLA-002 surpasses individual VLA
and world models, demonstrating their mutual enhancement. We evaluate RynnVLA-002 in both
simulation and real-world robot tasks. RynnVLA-002 achieves 97.4% success rate on the LIBERO
simulation benchmark without pretraining, while in real-world LeRobot experiments, its integrated
world model boosts the overall success rate by 50%.

Introduction
The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model has emerged as a promising paradigm for grounding language-
conditioned decision making in visual environments, enabling robots to map instructions and observations to
actions (Zitkovich et al., 2023, 2024). These models are constructed by augmenting large-scale pre-trained
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) (Liu et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2024a; Zhang et al., 2025a; Bai
et al., 2025) with either an action head or additional action expert module to generate actions. MLLMs
contribute robust capabilities in perception and decision making, enabling VLA models to exhibit enhanced
generalization across a wide range of robotic tasks (Black et al., 2024; Intelligence et al., 2025).
However, standard VLA architectures face three fundamental drawbacks. First, they cannot fully understand
actions because actions reside only on the output side, preventing the model from forming an explicit internal
representation of action dynamics. Second, they lack imagination: they do not predict how the world
might evolve given candidate actions, hindering foresight and counterfactual reasoning. Third, they have no
explicit understanding of physics. Without capturing physical dynamics, the model cannot internalize object
interactions, contact, or stability. World models directly address these limitations by learning to forecast
future observations conditioned on current images and actions, providing agents with action-aware internal
states, imagination, and a physics-informed representation of environment dynamics. (Ha and Schmidhuber,
2018; Wu et al., 2025a). Despite this advantage, world models are constrained by their inability to directly
generate action outputs, resulting in a functional gap that limits their application in scenarios requiring
explicit action planning.
To address the constraints inherent in both VLA models and world models, we introduce RynnVLA-002, an
autoregressive action world model for unified action and image understanding and generation. As depicted
in Fig. 1, RynnVLA-002 employs three separate tokenizers to encode images, text, and actions. The tokens
from different modalities are set to share the same vocabulary so that understanding and generation across
these modalities can be unified within a single LLM architecture. The world model component captures the
underlying physical dynamics of the environment by generating visual representations based on input actions.
This process of action interpretation and environmental physics learning is essential for enabling effective

decision making within the VLA model. At the same time, the VLA model embedded within RynnVLA-002
refines the understanding of visual data, thereby improving the precision of image generation performed by
the world model. This bidirectional enhancement creates a more robust and comprehensive model capable of
understanding and generating both actions and images.
In this work, we explore different action generation mechanisms. Our initial approach (i.e., WorldVLA (Cen
et al., 2025)) involved discretizing actions and unifying them with image and text tokens within a single
vocabulary. However, we find that this method struggles with generating coherent action chunks. The primary
reason for this is that pretrained multimodal language models have predominantly been exposed to images and
text rather than actions, resulting in limited action generalization capabilities. Furthermore, in autoregressive
models where subsequent actions are conditioned on preceding ones, error propagation becomes a critical issue,
as earlier incorrect predictions influence subsequent actions over time. To alleviate this issue, we proposed
an action attention masking strategy that selectively masks prior actions during the generation of current
actions. This approach effectively mitigates error accumulation and yields substantial improvements in the
task of action chunk generation in simulation.
However, in real-world robot experiments, this discrete design exhibits limited generalization capability
and slow inference. We attribute the poor generalization to the high-volume data requirement of discrete
autoregressive models (Kaplan et al., 2020), which is often unavailable in robotics. The slow inference,
meanwhile, stems from the sequential nature of the autoregressive generation process. To address these
issues, we evolve our architecture into a hybrid model that retains the original discrete joint modeling while
incorporating a continuous Action Transformer head (Zhao et al., 2023). This new head is significantly
smaller than the base LLM, which alleviates overfitting and improves generalization. Furthermore, the Action
Transformer’s parallel decoding and bidirectional attention mechanism reduce the number of decoding steps,
accelerating inference, and generating smoother trajectories.
In summary, our contributions are as follows:
• We propose RynnVLA-002, an action world model that unifies VLA and World Model in a single
framework.
• We introduce an action attention masking strategy for the discrete action chunk generation, addressing
the challenge of action error accumulation when autoregressively generating action sequences. An
additional continuous Action Transformer head is added for stronger generalization ability and smoother
trajectory.
• Our experiments demonstrate that RynnVLA-002 outperforms the standalone VLA and world models,

Vision-Language-Action Models
VLM-based VLA. Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based VLA models (Brohan et al., 2023; Cheang et al., 2024;
Wen et al., 2025b; Li et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2024; Belkhale and Sadigh, 2024; Zhao et al., 2025b; Wang
et al., 2025a,b) map visual–language inputs to actions. RT-2 (Zitkovich et al., 2023) first co-trained VLMs on
robotic trajectories and web-scale vision-language data, producing actions as discrete tokens. Subsequent
works (Wu et al., 2023; Zitkovich et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025b; Zhen et al., 2024; Pertsch et al., 2025) extend
this architecture to enhance generalization and representation efficiency. To address precision loss from discrete
tokens, LCB (Shentu et al., 2024) introduced a dual-system with a continuous policy head, inspiring variants
with different policy head models like diffusion transformers (Peebles and Xie, 2023), and incorporating
diverse training strategies across multiple embodiments (Zhang et al., 2024; Wen et al., 2024, 2025a; Zhou
et al., 2025; Li et al., 2024b). Recent frameworks such as π0 (Black et al., 2024) leverage conditional flow
matching (Lipman et al., 2022), the open-source GR00T (Bjorck et al., 2025) scales it to complex humanoid
control, and π0.5 (Intelligence et al., 2025) further improves generalization by leveraging large-scale multimodal
web and cross-embodiment data, enabling direct zero-shot deployment across robot platforms.
Visual Generation-based VLA. Beyond static perception, visual-generation approaches model dynamics by
predicting future visual states. UniPi (Du et al., 2023), DREAMGEN (Jang et al., 2025) and GeVRM (Zhang
et al., 2025b) generate future visual observations to guide action generation. Joint frameworks (Guo et al.,
2024; Zheng et al., 2025b; Li et al., 2025a) co-generate future frames and corresponding actions, enhancing
temporal consistency and policy learning. Others exploit future video prediction as a powerful pretraining
objective, including GR-2 (Cheang et al., 2024), VPP (Hu et al., 2024) and RynnVLA-001 (Jiang et al.,
2025). Collectively, these approaches highlight the potential of predictive visual modeling to bridge perception
and action, though challenges remain in visual fidelity, domain transfer, and computational efficiency. Our
RynnVLA-002 is built on Chameleon (Team, 2024), a unified model for image understanding and generation,
thus combining the benefits of both VLM and visual-generation-based approaches.

2.2
World Models
World models endow embodied AI with internal representations (Chen et al., 2022; Robine et al., 2023;
Wang et al., 2024) and predictive dynamics of the external world (Hafner et al., 2019, 2021; Okada and
Taniguchi, 2022), enabling physics-consistent interaction in dynamic environments (Xiang et al., 2023;
Mazzaglia et al., 2024; Ha and Schmidhuber, 2018). Recent advances have realized world models with
transformer-based architectures (Wu et al., 2025b; Robine et al., 2023; Micheli et al., 2022). Notably, Google’s
Genie framework (Bruce et al., 2024) constructs synthetic interactive environments through large-scale self-
supervised video pretraining. Nowadays, such world models are widely utilized to generate varied training
data (Agarwal et al., 2025), support model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (Wu et al., 2025a), and
aid in selecting the most suitable policies from a pool of generated options (Li et al., 2025a; Bar et al., 2024).
In this work, we show that world model and VLA could enhance each other.

Methods
3.1
Overview
The overall architecture of RynnVLA-002 is shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen, our RynnVLA-002 unifies two
foundational models in embodied AI. The first is the VLA model, where a policy π generates an action at
based on a language goal l, a proprioceptive state st−1, and an observation history ot−h:t:
at ∼π(at | l, st−1, ot−h:t).
(1)
The second is the world model, where the model f predicts the next observation ot from past observations
and actions:
ˆot ∼f(ot | ot−h:t−1, at−h:t−1).
(2)
We mix the VLA model data and the world model data to train the RynnVLA-002, an integrated model Mψ
that consolidates the capabilities of action prediction and world modeling. The dual nature of our model
is captured by its ability to be queried either as a VLA or as a world model, leveraging a shared group of
parameters ψ.
3.2
Data Tokenization
Tokenizers. We initialize the model from Chameleon (Team, 2024) since it is a unified model for image
understanding and generation. Four tokenizers are involved, including an image tokenizer, a text tokenizer, a
state tokenizer, and an action tokenizer. The image tokenizer is a VQ-GAN model (Esser et al., 2021) with
additional perceptual losses to specific image regions, e.g., faces and salient objects (Gafni et al., 2022). The
compression ratio of the image tokenizer is 16 and the codebook size is 8192. The image tokenizer generates
256 tokens for 256 × 256 images and 1024 tokens for 512 × 512 images. The text tokenizer is a trained BPE
tokenizer (Sennrich et al., 2015). The image and text tokenizers are inherited from Chameleon. The state and
action tokenizer discretizes each dimension of continuous robot proprioceptive states and actions into one of
256 bins, with bin widths determined by the range of the training data (Zitkovich et al., 2024, 2023). All
image, text, action, and state tokens are in a single token vocabulary with the size of 65536. The continuous
actions generated by the Action Transformer are raw actions without tokenization.
VLA Model Data. The overall token sequence of VLA model data is:
{text} {state} {image-front-wrist}
|
{z
}
×M
Ldis_action
z
}|
{
{action}
|
{z
}
×K
The VLA model generates K actions based on the language instruction, proprioceptive state, and M historical
image observations. The text inputs are “What action should the robot take to + <task>+ ?”. Ldis_action
refers to the cross-entropy loss of discrete action tokens.
World Model Data. World model generates the next image frame given the current image observation and
action. The overall token sequence is:

All of the training instances for world model share the same text prefix “Generate the next frame based on
the current image and the action.” and there are no other task instructions since the action could totally
determine the next state of the world. The overall generation could repeat N times in an autoregressive
manner. Limg refers to the cross-entropy loss of discrete image tokens.
Training Objective. We mix the VLA model data and world model data to train our RynnVLA-002. The overall
loss function is Ldis = Ldis_action + Limg. In this way, RynnVLA-002 could behave as the VLA model or
world model depending on the user queries.
3.3
Action Chunk Generation
Attention Mask for Discrete Action Chunk. Generating multiple actions for execution is critical for efficiency
and a higher success rate (Kim et al., 2025). However, we find that naively generating consecutive actions in
the autoregressive model degrades the performance. Although the foundational MLLM demonstrates robust
generalization capabilities across the image and text domains, its capacity to generalize effectively in the
action domain is comparatively limited. Consequently, errors originating from earlier actions propagate to
subsequent actions under the default causal attention mask, resulting in performance degradation. To address
this limitation, we introduce an alternative attention mask tailored for action generation, depicted in Fig. 3
(b). This modified mask ensures that current actions rely solely on textual and visual input, while prohibiting
access to prior actions. Such design enables the autoregressive framework to generate multiple actions in
isolation, mitigating the error accumulation problem. The world model part adheres to the conventional
attention mask, as shown in Fig. 3 (c).
Action Transformer for Continuous Action Chunk. Although our discrete action chunking model performs well in
simulation, it rarely succeeds in real-world robot experiments. This discrepancy arises because real-world
applications demand significantly higher generalization to cope with dynamic variables like lighting and
object positioning—factors not fully captured in simulation. The failure of our discrete model is rooted in
two key issues. First, its large autoregressive architecture is prone to severe overfitting when trained on
limited real-world dataset, leading to poor generalization. Second, our designed attention mask makes the
autoregressive model generate each action in isolation within the same chunk, which cannot ensure trajectory
continuity, resulting in severe shaking and non-smooth movements that drastically reduce the success rate.
To overcome these challenges, we propose to augment our architecture with a dedicated Action Transformer
to generate continuous action sequences (Zhao et al., 2023). This module processes the full context—including
language, image, and state tokens—and utilizes learnable action queries to output an entire action chunk
in parallel. This design provides two distinct advantages. First, the Action Transformer’s more compact

architecture is less prone to overfitting on limited data, thereby improving generalization and producing
fluid, stable actions. Second, by parallelly generating all actions in a single forward pass, it substantially
accelerates the inference speed compared to the autoregressive baselines that generate actions sequentially.
We use L1 regression loss Lconti_action to supervise the Action Transformer. The overall loss function is
L = Ldis + αLconti = Ldis_action + Limg + αLconti_action.

Experiments

Simulation Results
Benchmark. We evaluate our method on the LIBERO benchmark (Liu et al., 2023a). This benchmark is
composed of four distinct suites designed to test a range of robotic capabilities: (1) LIBERO-Spatial focuses
on spatial relationships by tasking the robot with placing a bowl in various locations; (2) LIBERO-Object
emphasizes object recognition and manipulation with unique objects; (3) LIBERO-Goal tests procedural
learning by varying task goals while using a fixed set of objects; (4) LIBERO-Long contains 10 complex
long-horizon manipulation tasks.
Dataset and Preprocessing. We first curate the dataset by removing unsuccessful trajectories and filtering
out “no-operation” actions, a procedure also adopted by OpenVLA (Zitkovich et al., 2024). For world model
evaluation, which relies on ground-truth video-action pairs, we partition the cleaned data into a 90% training
set and a 10% validation set.
Hyperparameter Settings.
The VLA model takes M = 2 historical image frames as input.
We set
the action chunk size K = 10 for the longer LIBERO-Long and LIBERO-Spatial tasks and K = 5
for the shorter LIBERO-Object and LIBERO-Goal tasks.
For the world model, we use a single pre-
diction round (N = 1) to maintain computational efficiency.
The loss weighting parameter α = 10.

Metrics. Our evaluation is twofold. To assess the
VLA model, we measure its success rate across 50
deployment rollouts per task, each initialized in a
different state. To assess the world model, we mea-
sure its video prediction accuracy on the held-out
validation set using four standard metrics: Fréchet
Video Distance (FVD), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ra-
tio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM),
and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity
(LPIPS).
Benchmark Results. We evaluate the performance
of discrete actions and continuous actions separately. As shown in Tab. 1, our RynnVLA-002 achieves high
success rates of 93.3% with discrete actions and 97.4% with continuous actions, demonstrating the effectiveness
of our core design principles: jointly learning the VLA modeling and world modeling, an attention mask
mechanism for discrete action generation, and the added continuous Action Transformer. Surprisingly, our
RynnVLA-002, without any pretraining, is still on par with strong baseline models pretrained on either
LIBERO-90 or massive real-robot datasets (Tian et al., 2024; Bu et al., 2025; Kim et al., 2025).

Real-World Robot Results
Datasets.
We curate a new real-world manipulation dataset collected with a LeRobot SO100 robotic
arm (Cadene et al., 2024). All trajectories are expert demonstrations obtained via human teleoperation. We
define two pick and place tasks for evaluation. (1) Place the block inside the circle: Emphasizing basic object
detection and grasp execution (248 demonstrations); (2) Place strawberries in the cup: Requiring fine-grained
localization and grasp-point prediction (249 demonstrations).
Baselines. We compare with two strong open-source baselines: GR00T N1.5 (Bjorck et al., 2025) and π0 (Black
et al., 2024). For both methods, we initialize from the official pretrained checkpoints and finetune them on
the same SO100 dataset used for our model. We adopt the same recipe from the official codebases of these
baselines to do finetuning.
Evaluation. As shown in Fig. 4, our evaluation spans three scenarios: (1) Single-target manipulation, with
exactly one target object on the desktop; (2) Multi-target manipulation, with multiple target objects present;
and (3) Instruction-following with distractors, where both targets and distractors appear. A trial is deemed
successful if the robot places at least one target object into its designated location within a predefined time
budget. A trial fails if: (1) the time limit is exceeded; (2) the robot accrues more than five consecutive failed
grasp attempts on a target; (3) in the instruction-following with distractors setting, the agent attempts to
manipulate any distractor objects. Each task is tested for 10 times and we report the success rate.
Results. Tab. 2 shows the results of real-world robot experiments. Our RynnVLA-002 achieves competitive
results with GR00T N1.5 (Bjorck et al., 2025) and π0 (Black et al., 2024) without pretraining. Notably,
RynnVLA-002 performs better than the baselines in cluttered environments. For instance, RynnVLA-002 has
over 80% success rate on both multi-target tasks and distractor-filled scenarios for the "Place the block" task,
surpassing the baselines by 10% to 30%.

Ablation Study
World Model Benefits the VLA Model. On the LIBERO simulation benchmark, incorporating world model data
during training consistently improves performance. Specifically, in Tab. 3, the success rate for discrete actions
increases from 62.8% (Line 1) to 67.8% (Line 2), and from 76.6% (Line 4) to 78.1% (Line 5). A similar trend
is observed for continuous actions in Tab. 4, where the success rate increases from 91.6% (Line 2) to 94.6%
(Line 3). In real-world robot experiments, the benefit of world model data is even more pronounced. As shown
in Line 4 of Tab. 5, the model trained without world model data achieves a very low success rate on real-world
robot tasks, which is below 30%. In contrast, augmenting VLA training with world model significantly boosts
performance to over 80%. Fig. 5 shows that the model trained without world model data moves directly
toward the target location without successfully grasping the cheese or bottle, while the model jointly trained
with world model keeps retrying to grasp the target object when encountering failures. This behavior suggests
that the world model data helps the VLA model focus more on the manipulated objects—because the world
model’s training objective requires accurate prediction of object motion, thereby reinforcing attention to
object interaction dynamics.
VLA Model Enhances the World Model.
As shown in Tab. 6, the model trained on a mixture of VLA
and world model data achieves generation results that are comparable to or better than those of the
world model trained solely on world data.
Furthermore, Fig. 7 compares video generations from our
action world model with a baseline world model trained without VLA data. The baseline world model
fails to predict a successful grasp of the bowl from the front camera perspective in both two examples.

In contrast, our action world model consistently
generates correct videos depicting a successful
grasp. Notably, the baseline world model also
exhibits a significant inconsistency: as seen in
Fig. 7 (a), the front camera shows a failed grasp
while the wrist camera shows a successful one.
This highlights a critical disalignment between
the model’s predictions for different viewpoints.
The visualization results validate that the im-
age understanding capabilities inherited from
the VLA model strengthen the world model’s
generation performance.
Attention Mask for Discrete Action Chunk Genera-
tion. Simultaneous generation of multiple actions
is essential for achieving effective and efficient
grasping. However, we observe that a vanilla
autoregressive approach—where actions are gen-
erated sequentially—can degrade model perfor-
mance, as evidenced by the results in row 3 of Table 3 and Fig. 6. The grasping success rate gradually
decreases with longer action chunks. This degradation arises because later actions become overly dependent
on preceding ones since they share the same space, rather than being grounded in visual input which is
a distinct modality. The generalization of the action is not that strong as this modality was not involved
during pretraining the MLLM. Consequently, errors tend to accumulate as the sequence of generated actions
increases. The proposed attention masking mechanism ensures that each action is generated independently
and solely determined by the visual input, thereby mitigating the issue of error propagation within the action
sequence. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the model incorporating the proposed attention mask demonstrates superior
performance compared to the vanilla attention mask, particularly under conditions of longer chunk lengths.
This highlights the efficacy of the introduced masking approach. If the length of the action chunk is excessively
prolonged, the robot’s ability to timely adapt its policy becomes constrained, leading to a decline in overall
performance.
DiscreteActionsAcceleratetheConvergence. We retain discrete actions during training alongside the continuous
Action Transformer, as we find that this hybrid approach not only speeds up the convergence of VLA training

but also improves the ultimate success rate. As
shown in Fig. 8, models trained with discrete
action tokens achieve a substantially higher suc-
cess rate than those trained without them, with
the advantage being most pronounced during the
initial stages of training.
Ablation Study of Wrist Camera and Proprioceptive
State. As shown in Line 1 of Tab. 4, our model
could achieve reasonable performance without
the wrist camera or proprioceptive state on the
LIBERO simulation benchmark. Incorporating these two sources of information brings in further performance

gains (see Line 2 and Line 4 in Tab. 4). In real-world experiments (Line 2 and Line 3 in Tab. 5), the robot
consistently fails when the wrist camera or proprioceptive state is absent. On one hand, the wrist camera
provides crucial visual feedback on the relative pose between the gripper and the object, especially when the
robot is outside the field of view of the front camera. On the other hand, we find proprioceptive state is
essential for accurately timing gripper closure and object lifting during manipulation.
Efficiency Analysis. As shown in Tab. 7, incorporating additional input images, such as images from the wrist
camera or historical frames, improves performance but reduces speed. For discrete actions, action chunking
yields both higher inference speed and better performance compared to generating a single action per inference
step. Continuous action generation is significantly faster owing to its parallel generation nature, and frequency
scale almost linearly with chunk size as generating additional actions incurs negligible extra time.
Discrete Action and Continuous Action. Our model supports both discrete and continuous action generation,
and the experimental results reveal a clear advantage for the latter. Concretely, in the LIBERO simulation
benchmark, continuous actions result in significantly faster convergence (Fig. 9). Although the final per-
formances of these two models in simulation are comparable, their performance gap becomes considerably
significant in real-robot experiments. As shown in Table 5, our real-world experiments demonstrate a much
more substantial improvement when using continuous actions over discrete ones.

World Model Pretraining for VLA Model.
Our
RynnVLA-002 unifies VLA model and world
model into a single training stage. We further
investigate the possibility of cold starting a VLA
model with world model pretraining. This form
of pretraining necessitates that the model de-
velop an understanding of visual inputs, actions,
and the underlying physical dynamics governing state transitions. We pretrain the model using the same
data source as the VLA model. As presented in Table 8, employing the world model for pretraining leads to

notable improvements in grasping performance. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging world
model pretraining in robotic applications, particularly in enhancing task-specific performance through prior
exposure to general world knowledge.

Conclusion
In this work, we propose RynnVLA-002, a unified framework that integrates the VLA and world model,
demonstrating that they enhance each other. Through this contribution, we aim to offer the embodied AI
research community a concrete methodology for enabling the synergistic interplay between the VLA and world
model. Furthermore, we believe this work helps lay the groundwork for a unified foundation for multi-modal
understanding and generation that spans text, vision, and action.
