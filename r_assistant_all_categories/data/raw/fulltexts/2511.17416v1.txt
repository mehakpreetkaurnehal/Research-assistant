Abstract—Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have emerged as a rev-
olutionary technology offering enhanced spatial diversity within
a compact form factor. Concurrently, unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) are integral to future networks, necessitating channel
models that capture both multipath fading and shadowing.
This letter presents a novel performance analysis of a UAV-to-
ground link, where the receiver is equipped with an N-port FAS
operating over the challenging double-shadowing fading channel.
By adapting a tractable eigenvalue-based approximation for the
correlated FAS ports, we derive new analytical expressions for the
end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio statistics, namely the cumulative
distribution function and the probability density function. Based
on these statistics, we present exact integral expressions for the
outage probability, average bit error rate, and average channel
capacity. We further derive new, tractable closed-form solutions
for the average bit error rate and capacity for the practical dual-
rank, independent but non-identically distributed case. Finally,
a key asymptotic analysis reveals that the system achieves a
multiplicative diversity order of Gd = M × d, which is precisely
the product of the FAS spatial rank M and the intrinsic channel
diversity order d. Simulation results are provided to validate the
high accuracy of our entire theoretical framework.

I. INTRODUCTION
U
NMANNED aerial vehicles (UAVs) are poised to be-
come a critical component of future wireless networks,
offering flexible, on-demand deployment for applications rang-
ing from aerial base stations (BSs) to mobile relays [1]. But
the unique characteristics of the air-to-ground (A2G) channel,
which differs greatly from terrestrial models, presents a major
communication challenge [2]. The A2G link is often subject to
both small-scale multipath fading and large-scale shadowing
from buildings, foliage, or the UAV airframe itself [3]. To
capture this behavior accurately, the double-shadowed (DS)
fading model is widely adopted, which composites Nakagami-
m fading with Inverse-Gamma (IG) shadowing, resulting in a
tractable Meijer’s G-function representation [4].
To strengthen the A2G channel, the emerging fluid antenna
system (FAS) concept seems useful. FAS treats antenna as a re-
configurable physical-layer resource to empower the physical
layer with shape and position flexibility [5], [6], [7], and has
recently attracted much interest [8], [9], [10]. FAS is especially

appealing in space-constrained devices by allowing one radio-
frequency (RF) chain to effectively retrieve spatial diversity
over a compact aperture [11], [12]. While FAS is a natural fit
for space-constrained UAV ground receivers, the performance
of an FAS-enabled receiver operating over the complex, non-
Rayleigh DS channel remains unknown.
Technically speaking, the correlation among the FAS ports
makes direct analysis of the maximum signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) extremely challenging. In [13], a tractable eigenvalue-
based framework was proposed, which models the N corre-
lated ports as M independent but non-identically distributed
(i.n.i.d.) eigen-modes (M ≤N), and is shown to be highly
accurate for Rayleigh channels. However, the required analysis
for FAS-UAV is highly non-trivial, requiring the unification
of the complex eigenvalue-based FAS approximation with the
Meijer’s G-function statistics of the DS channel.
In this letter, we bridge this significant gap. First, we derive
the foundational end-to-end statistics, i.e., cumulative density
function (CDF)/probability density function (PDF), for an
M-rank FAS receiver over the DS channel by successfully
integrating the eigenvalue approximation with the G-function-
based channel statistics. Second, based on this new framework,
we derive exact analytical expressions for the system’s outage
probability, average bit error rate (ABER), and average channel
capacity. Third, we derive new tractable closed-form solutions
for the ABER and average capacity for the M = 2 i.n.i.d. case.
Finally, we carry out an asymptotic analysis at high SNR,
proving that the system achieves a total diversity order of
Gd = M ×d. This key result reveals the overall diversity to be
the product of the FAS spatial rank M and the intrinsic channel
diversity order d. Monte-Carlo simulations validate the high
accuracy of our framework against both the approximation
model and the exact N-port physical simulation.
II. SYSTEM AND CHANNEL MODELS
As shown in Fig. 1, we consider a point-to-point communi-
cation system where a single-antenna transmitter (Tx) mounted
on a UAV communicates with a ground-based receiver (Rx).
The Rx is equipped with an N-port FAS, where the N ports
are assumed to be equally spaced along a linear dimension
of length Wλ, with λ being the carrier wavelength. These
N ports are connected to a single RF chain, and the receiver
selects the port that achieves the maximum SNR.
A. UAV-to-Ground (UAV-G) Channel Model
We adopt the statistical fading channel model developed
for UAV-G communications, which accurately accounts for
both multipath fading and shadowing effects. We focus on the
DS model as it represents the more general and challenging
scenario where shadowing is present in the vicinity.
The DS model assumes the channel gain is a product of four
independent random variables: h = X1X2Y1Y2, in which Xj

models IG shadowing and Yj models Nakagami-m multipath
fading, for j ∈{1, 2}. The instantaneous received power is
Pr ∝|h|2, and thus the instantaneous SNR γ = Pr/N0 is a
product of four independent power terms. Specifically, as X2
j
follows an IG distribution, its PDF is given by
fX2
j (x) = (αj −1)αj
Γ(αj)
x−αj−1e−
αj −1
x
, x > 0,
(1)
where Γ(·) is the Gamma function. Also, as Y 2
j is distributed
according to a Gamma distribution, the corresponding PDF is
expressed as
fY 2
j (y) =
mmj
j
Γ(mj)ymj−1e−mjy, y > 0.
(2)
The PDF of the product of these four random variables (RVs),
γ, can be found using the Mellin transform, which results in
the Meijer G-function representation given by [2, (4)] as

where γ = E[γ] denotes the average SNR, and mj and αj
are the shape parameters, and Gm,n
p,q (·) denotes the Meijer’s
G-function [16]. Additionally, the constant SDS is defined as
SDS = [Γ(m1)Γ(m2)Γ(α1)Γ(α2)]−1. Therefore, the corre-
sponding CDF of the SNR is derived by integrating the PDF,
FγDS(γ) =

B. FAS Receiver Model
We assume that the N-port FAS at the receiver always
selects the port with the highest instantaneous SNR. The
output SNR of the FAS is therefore given by
γFAS = max{γ1, γ2, . . . , γN},
(5)
where γn = γ|hn|2 is the SNR at the n-th port. Due to the
compact physical placement of the N ports, the channel gains
{hn}N
n=1 are spatially correlated. This spatial correlation is
commonly captured by the Jakes’ model, which defines the
(p, q)-th entry of the covariance matrix J as [14], [15]
[J]p,q = J0

2π |p −q|
N −1 W

,
(6)
where p, q ∈{1, . . . , N} and J0(·) is the zeroth-order Bessel
function of the first kind. The analysis of the maximum of
these N correlated RVs is generally intractable.
To overcome this, we adopt the novel analytical framework
proposed in [13]. This approach approximates the statistics
of the maximum of N correlated RVs by the statistics of the
maximum of M i.n.i.d. RVs. Here, M = Rank{J} is the num-
ber of non-zero eigenvalues of the channel covariance matrix
J = E{hhH}, where h = [h1, . . . , hN]T . By performing an
eigenvalue decomposition on J, we have
J = UΛUH,
(7)
where U is a unitary matrix containing the eigenvectors and
Λ = diag(λ1, . . . , λM, 0, . . . , 0) is the diagonal matrix of the
M non-zero eigenvalues, λi. The rank M ≤N represents
the effective spatial degrees of freedom. This decomposition
allows the channel vector h to be represented as h = UΛ1/2z,
where z is a vector of independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) complex Gaussian RVs. The approximation framework
leverages this by modeling the system as M independent
branches, each weighted by eigenvalue λi.
We generalize this approximation from [13, (20)] to our
non-Rayleigh DS shadowed fading channels. The output SNR
of the FAS is approximated as
γFAS ≈γapprox = max
n
λ1γ(1), λ2γ(2), . . . , λMγ(M)o
,
(8)
where {γ(i)}M
i=1 are i.i.d. RVs, each following FγDS(·).
C. Statistics of the FAS Output SNR
Based on the approximation (8), we now derive the novel
statistical expressions for the FAS output SNR, γFAS.
1) CDF: The CDF of γFAS is defined as FγFAS(γ) =
P(γFAS ≤γ). Using (8), the CDF is expressed as

where step (a) follows from the independence of the γ(i) RVs,
and FγDS(·) is the single-link DS CDF from (4). Substituting
(4) into (9) yields the new CDF

III. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
We now leverage the new statistical characterizations to
evaluate the primary performance metrics of the system.
A. Outage Probability
The outage probability is the probability that the FAS output
SNR, γFAS, falls below a predefined threshold γth. This is
formally defined by integrating the PDF as
Pout =
Z γth
0
fγFAS(γ)dγ = FγFAS(γth).
(13)
By substituting γth directly into our new CDF expression (10),
we obtain the novel outage probability in a tractable form as

where ci = m1m2/(γλi), a = {1 −α2, 1 −α1, 1}, and b =

B. ABER
The ABER is calculated by averaging the conditional error
probability (CEP) over the SNR distribution as
PABER =
Z ∞
0
Pe(γ)fγFAS(γ)dγ,
(16)
where Pe(γ) is the CEP for a given modulation. For binary
phase shift keying (BPSK), Pe(γ) = Q(√2κγ), where Q(·)
is the Gaussian Q-function and κ = 1. Using the alternative
form Q(x) = 1

where MγFAS(s) = E[e−sγFAS] is the moment generating

of i.n.i.d. G-distributed RVs is intractable. Note that a more
tractable approach, which utilizes the CDF, is given by [2,

where the vector notation a−(β+n) implies subtraction from
the first two elements only, i.e., {1−α2 −β −n, 1−α1 −β −

β + n), 1 −(β + n)}. Substituting (22) into (19) provides a
new, exact analytical expression for the ABER.

C = E[B log2(1 + γFAS)] =

D. Asymptotic Analysis: Diversity Order
To gain simpler insights, we analyze the outage probability
in the high-SNR regime where γ →∞. First, we require
the asymptotic behavior of the single-link CDF from (4). For
cascaded fading channels, the CDF at γ →0 behaves as
FγUAV (γ) ∝γd, where d is the single-link diversity order,
given by d = min(α1, α2, m1, m2) for the DS case [2, (24)].
Based on this, we analyze the CDF from (9) as
Pout = FγFAS(γth) =
M
Y
i=1
FγDS(γth/λi)

Y
i=1
 K · (γth/λi)d
= KM(γth)Md
 M
Y
i=1
λi
!−d
.
The diversity orde is defined as Gd = −lim
γ→∞
log Pout
log γ . Since
K, γth, and λi are constants with respect to γ, but the
constant K itself contains γ−d (from the normalized G-
function argument), Pout ∝(γ−d)M = (γ)−Md. Thus, we
find the system diversity order Gd to be
Gd = M × d.
(28)
This is a powerful and intuitive result. It proves that the total
system diversity order is the product of the spatial diversity
rank M afforded by the FAS [13] and the intrinsic diversity
order d of the single-link shadowed fading channel.
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we present numerical and simulation results
to validate the accuracy of our derived analytical framework
and to quantify the performance of the proposed FAS-enabled
UAV-G link over DS channels. Unless stated otherwise, the
number of independent realizations is 2×106. The baseline DS
channel parameters are adopted as m1 = 2.1, m2 = 2.4, α1 =
2.1, and α2 = 2.4. The outage threshold is set to γth = 0 dB,
and the ABER is evaluated for BPSK (κ = 1, β = 0.5).
Fig. 2 presents the validation for the three primary perfor-
mance metrics. For all metrics and all FAS configurations, the
analytical curves, the approximate simulation, and the exact
physical simulation are in perfect agreement. This result is
highly significant, as it validates the two foundational pillars
of this work: 1) first, the eigenvalue-based approximation from
[13] is robust and highly accurate even when applied to the
complex non-Rayleigh DS channel, and also 2) our novel, G-
function-based analytical expressions are valid. Additionally,
Figs. 2a and 2b clearly illustrate the substantial diversity gain
provided by FAS. The slope of the outage probability/ABER
curves becomes progressively steeper as the effective rank M
increases. The fixed-position antenna (FPA) case exhibits a
diversity order limited by the channel parameters, d = 2.1. The
M = 4 and M = 8 configurations show significantly steeper
slopes, visually confirming our asymptotic diversity order
analysis in (28), where the total diversity order Gd = M × d.
Fig. 2c further confirms the multiplexing gain, showing that a
higher rank M provides a greater capacity slope.
Fig. 3 investigates the impact of the unique UAV channel
parameters on system performance, using the now-validated
theoretical outage probability curves for a fixed FAS configu-
ration. Fig. 3a shows the effect of multipath fading by varying
m while keeping α = 2.1 constant. As m decreases from
light fading, near-line-of-sight to severe fading, approaching
Rayleigh-like conditions, the performance degrades greatly, as
a lower m implies a higher probability of deep fades. Fig. 3b
shows the effect of shadowing by varying α while keeping
m = 2.1 constant. A more pronounced degradation is observed
as α decreases from light shadowing to heavy shadowing. This
demonstrates that severe shadowing, a key characteristic of

Fig. 4. Impact of FAS parameters on outage probability.
A2G links, is a dominant factor in system performance, and
validates that our model correctly captures this sensitivity.
Fig. 4 serves a dual purpose, illustrating both the physical
benefits of FAS and the fidelity boundaries of the eigenvalue-
based analytical approximation. Fig. 4a clearly demonstrates
rank saturation: for a fixed aperture (W = 1.5λ), increasing
the number of physical ports N from 8 (M = 7) to 16
(M = 8) yields marginal diversity gain. This result confirms
that the system’s performance gain is fundamentally governed
by the effective rank M, which quickly saturates within a
small physical volume, regardless of further increases in N.
Conversely, Fig. 4b highlights the decorrelation gain, where
increasing the aperture W allows M to approach the physical
limit (M = N = 8), resulting in maximum performance.
Critically, these results reveal the model’s limitation: a mea-
surable deviation exists between the Exact Simulation and
the Approximate Simulation exclusively in the highly rank-
deficient scenario (N = 16, M = 8). This divergence arises
because the approximate model’s predicted diversity order
(Gd = M × d = 16.8) theoretically exceeds the physical
channel capacity constrained by the N = 16 ports. Conse-
quently, the approximation exhibits a predictable, optimistic
bias when Gd is constrained by N, confirming its highest
fidelity is reserved for full-rank systems where M = N.
V. CONCLUSION
In this letter, we established a novel analytical framework
for an N-port FAS receiver operating over DS-UAV channels.
By leveraging an eigenvalue-based approximation, we derived
new analytical expressions for the end-to-end SNR statistics,
e.g., both CDF and PDF, which enabled us to present exact
integral definitions for the outage probability, ABER, and
average channel capacity. We further presented new closed-
form solutions for the ABER and capacity for the practical
M = 2 i.n.i.d. case and proved that the system achieves a
multiplicative diversity order of Gd = M ×d. This theoretical
framework was comprehensively validated against Monte-
Carlo simulations, which confirmed the high accuracy of the
FAS approximation in Nakagami-m channels. Our results also
quantified the practical trade-offs between port density and
physical aperture, confirming our model’s applicability for
realistic FAS design in UAV networks.
