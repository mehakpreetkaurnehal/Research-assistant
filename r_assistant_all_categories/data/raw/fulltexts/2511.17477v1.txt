Recent advances in multimodal deep learning have greatly enhanced the capability of systems for
speech analysis and pronunciation assessment. Accurate pronunciation detection remains a key
challenge in Arabic, particularly in the context of Qur’anic recitation, where subtle phonetic dif-
ferences can alter meaning. Addressing this challenge, the present study proposes a transformer-
based multimodal framework for Arabic phoneme mispronunciation detection that combines
acoustic and textual representations to achieve higher precision and robustness. The framework
integrates UniSpeech-derived acoustic embeddings with BERT-based textual embeddings ex-
tracted from Whisper transcriptions, creating a unified representation that captures both phonetic
detail and linguistic context. To determine the most effective integration strategy, early, interme-
diate, and late fusion methods were implemented and evaluated on two datasets containing 29
Arabic phonemes, including eight hafiz sounds, articulated by 11 native speakers. Additional
speech samples collected from publicly available YouTube recordings were incorporated to
enhance data diversity and generalization. Model performance was assessed using standard
evaluation metrics—accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score—allowing a detailed comparison
of the fusion strategies. Experimental findings show that the UniSpeech–BERT multimodal
configuration provides strong results and that fusion-based transformer architectures are effective
for phoneme-level mispronunciation detection. The study contributes to the development of
intelligent, speaker-independent, and multimodal Computer-Aided Language Learning (CALL)
systems, offering a practical step toward technology-supported Qur’anic pronunciation training
and broader speech-based educational applications.
1. Introduction
The Holy Qur’an, revered as the divine scripture of the Islamic world, serves not only as a spiritual text but also as
a central cultural, social, and educational reference. For millions of believers, the Qur’an is regarded as the literal Word
of God, guiding every aspect of life. In this context, accurate recitation is essential, as it forms the foundation of both
individual worship and collective ritual practice. Preserving the phonetic and semantic integrity of the original Arabic
text is vital to conveying its meaning correctly. Arabic pronunciation, particularly in Qur’anic recitation, requires high
precision: even a single mispronunciation can alter meaning or lessen the Qur’an’s aesthetic and spiritual impact.
Therefore, developing automated tools that assist learners in achieving correct recitation is crucial for improving the
quality of religious education and strengthening individuals’ engagement with the Qur’an, especially in communities
where Arabic is not a native language (El Kheir et al., 2025).
Non-native learners of Arabic often face difficulties in mastering Qur’anic pronunciation. The phonetic and
phonological structure of Arabic—including the makhraj (points of articulation) and sifat (articulatory characteristics)
of letters—requires careful attention. Errors in pronouncing even a single sound may cause changes in meaning or
obscure the intended message. Traditionally, identifying and correcting such mispronunciations has depended on
qualified instructors, which limits access to effective training, particularly in regions with scarce educational resources.
Automatic pronunciation assessment systems provide a promising alternative. By analyzing speech input, detecting
pronunciation errors, and offering immediate feedback, they allow learners to practice independently while ensuring
accessibility and consistency in evaluation (Algabri et al., 2022a; Bahi, 2024).

Enhancing Quranic Learning: A Multimodal Deep Learning Approach for Arabic Phoneme Recognition
In recent years, deep learning techniques have achieved significant progress in both natural language processing
(NLP) and speech analysis. Among these methods, transformer-based architectures have gained prominence due to
their ability to model long-term dependencies and capture linguistic subtleties that traditional approaches often miss.
In speech and pronunciation tasks, such models can recognize fine acoustic differences with high accuracy (Vaswani
et al., 2017). Furthermore, multimodal learning, which integrates multiple data types such as audio, text, and visual
inputs, enables a more comprehensive representation of speech phenomena. For example, in Arabic letter recognition,
multimodal methods can combine the audio signal with corresponding textual or phonetic information—and, in some
cases, visual cues such as lip movements—to enhance robustness and reduce ambiguity (Zhu et al., 2023).
Based on these developments, the present study introduces a multimodal transformer-based system for Arabic
letter recognition and mispronunciation detection in Qur’anic recitation. The proposed approach examines early,
middle, and late fusion strategies for integrating acoustic and textual features. Transformer models are used to
extract relevant information from audio signals, which is then combined with complementary modalities to produce
a unified representation. These fusion strategies are compared to determine which method most effectively supports
pronunciation accuracy. In addition to error detection, the system aims to serve as a practical learning aid, providing
feedback that helps learners improve their recitation quality.
The main contributions of this study are summarized below:
• A multimodal framework is developed for Arabic phoneme recognition in the Qur’anic context, systematically
comparing early, mid, and late fusion strategies to clarify trade-offs and inform future research.
• The proposed system offers a practical and accessible solution for non-native Arabic speakers, supporting
individualized learning and improving access to quality religious education.
• The study demonstrates the applicability of deep learning and transformer models in pronunciation assessment
by adapting these methods to the domain of religious education.
• The research illustrates how technological advances can be effectively aligned with cultural and religious
practices, providing a foundation for future interdisciplinary work.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related literature on Qur’anic pronunciation
challenges and previous research on automatic pronunciation evaluation for Arabic. Section 3 presents the proposed
multimodal fusion framework, describing the early, mid, and late fusion strategies in detail. Section 4 outlines
the dataset and experimental methodology, explaining how transformer-based architectures were applied for feature
extraction and fusion. Section 5 reports and discusses the experimental results, and Section ?? concludes the paper
with the main findings and directions for future work.
2. Literature Review
This section reviews previous research on mispronunciation detection across different languages, with a particular
focus on studies related to Arabic phonemes and Qur’anic recitation.
Early efforts in Arabic mispronunciation detection primarily relied on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
In (Nazir et al., 2019), two CNN-based approaches were introduced: a CNN-feature extraction method and a transfer
learning-based method. In the first approach, features extracted from intermediate CNN layers (layers 4–7) were
classified using KNN, SVM, and neural network classifiers, while the second approach adapted a pre-trained CNN
through transfer learning. The transfer learning-based method achieved the best performance, reaching an accuracy of
92.2%, compared with 82% for traditional hand-crafted features and 91.7% for CNN-based features. Building on these
results, (Akhtar et al., 2020) employed AlexNet to extract deep features from layers 6–8 and trained classifiers such as
KNN, SVM, and Random Forest. With the inclusion of transfer learning and feature selection, the approach achieved
an average accuracy of 93.2%, highlighting the benefit of deeper and more discriminative CNN representations.
End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) architectures have also been explored for mispronunciation
detection. The study by (Lo et al., 2020) introduced a CTC–Attention hybrid model that unifies alignment and
recognition within a single framework, eliminating the need for phoneme-level forced alignment. Applied to Mandarin
speech data, this approach demonstrated improved accuracy and simplified model design compared with traditional
DNN–HMM systems.

Several studies have specifically targeted Classical Arabic pronunciation. In (Asif et al., 2021), a deep neural
network was trained on a newly collected dataset to recognize short vowels, achieving an accuracy of 95.77%. Similarly,
(Farooq and Imran, 2021) focused on detecting errors in the articulation points of Arabic letters using RASTA-PLP
feature extraction combined with an HMM classifier. Reported accuracies reached 85%, 90%, and 98% for different
experimental setups, indicating the feasibility of technology-assisted pronunciation evaluation for Arabic. Another
related work, (Alqadheeb et al., 2021), collected 2,892 audio samples covering 84 short-vowel classes and employed
a sequential CNN on 312 phonemes from the Arabic alphabet. The system achieved 100% testing accuracy and a loss
of 0.27, demonstrating the capability of CNN-based methods for precise Arabic phoneme classification.
For non-native Arabic learners, (Algabri et al., 2022b) developed a comprehensive Computer-Assisted Pronunci-
ation Training (CAPT) system capable of identifying mispronounced phonemes and their corresponding articulation
features (AFs). The problem was formulated as a multi-label recognition task, and an additional speech corpus was
synthesized using TTS technology. The best-performing model achieved a phoneme error rate (PER) of 3.83%, an
F1-score of 70.53% for mispronunciation detection, and a detection error rate (DER) of 2.6% for AF identification,
outperforming previous end-to-end systems.
Beyond Arabic, recent studies have explored advanced neural architectures for multilingual pronunciation model-
ing. PeppaNet (Yan et al., 2023), for example, proposed a unified end-to-end neural model that jointly performs align-
ment and dictation, integrating phonetic and phonological cues through a selective gating mechanism. Experiments on
the L2-ARCTIC benchmark dataset showed notable improvements over earlier state-of-the-art systems.
In the specific context of Qur’anic recitation, (Harere and Jallad, 2023) applied LSTM models with MFCC features
to detect sequential pronunciation errors corresponding to Tajweed rules. Using the QDAT dataset, the model achieved
accuracies of 96%, 95%, and 96% for Separate Stretching, Tight Noon, and Hide rules, respectively, surpassing
conventional machine learning baselines.
A recent study (Calık et al., 2023) proposed an ensemble-based approach for detecting mispronunciations of
Arabic phonemes within a computer-assisted language learning (CALL) framework. The study introduced an ensemble
model that integrates multiple conventional machine learning algorithms to identify mispronunciations and provide
corrective feedback for Arabic pronunciation learning. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this work represents the
first comprehensive attempt to apply ensemble learning techniques to Arabic phoneme mispronunciation detection.
In the experiments, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and Mel-spectrogram features were extracted and
combined with various classifiers to evaluate their impact on performance. The dataset consisted of recordings of 29
Arabic letters, including eight hafiz sounds, produced by 11 speakers, and was augmented through noise addition,
time shifting, stretching, and pitch modification. Experimental results showed that the ensemble voting classifier using
Mel-spectrogram features achieved the best performance, with an accuracy of 95.9%, demonstrating the potential of
ensemble learning for improving Arabic pronunciation assessment systems.
More recent work has shifted toward transformer-based and audio-oriented architectures. (Calik et al., 2024) com-
pared SEW, HuBERT, Wav2Vec, and UniSpeech models for Arabic phoneme mispronunciation detection. Experiments
conducted on two datasets covering 29 Arabic phonemes indicated that UniSpeech achieved the highest accuracy, while
the study also discussed potential areas for improvement. Similarly, (Alrashoudi et al., 2025) developed a transformer-
based approach for detecting and classifying phoneme-level errors by type (insertion, deletion, substitution). Using a
dataset containing native and non-native Arabic speakers, the system achieved detection and diagnosis accuracies of
91.3% and 80.8%, respectively, outperforming human evaluators in certain conditions.
Addressing the challenge of data imbalance, (Lounis et al., 2025) proposed a one-class CNN-based framework
trained exclusively on correctly pronounced samples, treating mispronunciations as outliers. Experiments on the Arabic
Speech Mispronunciation Detection Dataset (ASMDD) yielded an accuracy of approximately 84%, demonstrating the
potential of unsupervised or semi-supervised strategies for this domain. Complementing these developments, (Haouhat
et al., 2025) conducted a comprehensive review of Arabic multimodal machine learning (MML) studies, identifying
major datasets, applications, and challenges, and outlining directions for future research.
In contrast to prior works, which often focus solely on acoustic cues or limited subsets of Arabic phonemes,
the present study introduces a multimodal transformer-based framework that integrates both acoustic and textual
information for Arabic phoneme mispronunciation detection. Furthermore, a dedicated dataset of Arabic letters has
been constructed to support model training and benchmarking. This approach aims to enhance detection accuracy and
robustness while providing a foundation for future studies on pronunciation assessment and computer-assisted Qur’anic
education.

3. Multimodal Fusion
Multimodal fusion is an approach that combines information from multiple data sources to take advantage of the
complementary strengths of each modality. This integration helps overcome the limitations of relying on a single
modality, promotes data diversity, and enables the creation of richer and more representative feature spaces. Fusion
strategies are generally grouped into three main categories: early, intermediate, and late fusion.
In the early fusion approach, features extracted from different modalities are directly combined and processed
by a single model. This allows the model to learn interactions between modalities at the feature level but may
also introduce challenges such as increased dimensionality and potential incompatibility between modality scales.
In contrast, intermediate fusion processes each modality independently within separate networks and merges their
feature representations at selected intermediate layers. This strategy helps retain modality-specific characteristics while
allowing a more balanced information exchange. The late fusion approach involves training independent classifiers
for each modality and combining their outputs to reach a final decision. Late fusion preserves the independence
of modalities and reduces the negative influence of potential errors from any single modality on the overall system
performance Li and Tang (2024).
In the current study, multimodal fusion techniques are applied to improve mispronunciation detection by integrating
complementary information from acoustic and textual modalities. UniSpeech embeddings Wang et al. (2021) are
employed to capture fine-grained phonetic and prosodic cues, while BERT embeddings Devlin et al. (2019) derived
from phoneme-level transcriptions generated by Whisper Radford et al. (2022) encode semantic, syntactic, and
contextual information. The integration of these complementary representations forms a unified embedding space that
models both phonetic and linguistic dimensions of speech. This shared representation aligns pronunciation patterns
with their linguistic context, which is critical for accurate mispronunciation detection. Detailed descriptions of the
models used in this study are provided in the following subsections.
3.1. Robust Speech Recognition (Whisper)
The Whisper model Radford et al. (2022) represents a recent advancement in automatic speech recognition
(ASR), designed to transcribe speech across different languages and challenging acoustic environments. Whisper
employs a transformer-based encoder–decoder architecture capable of modeling long-range dependencies and temporal
relationships within audio sequences. By processing raw audio waveforms sampled at 16 kHz, the model effectively
encodes phonetic and prosodic information, yielding accurate and contextually consistent transcriptions.
A key feature of Whisper is its robustness to diverse acoustic conditions and speaker variations. Trained on a
large-scale multilingual and multitask dataset, the model generalizes well across languages, accents, and speech styles.
Its training strategy combines supervised learning on labeled datasets with multitask objectives, enhancing adaptability
and enabling reliable transcription performance even in noisy or non-standard speech.
Whisper’s self-attention mechanisms capture contextual relationships across complete utterances, allowing the
model to maintain coherence between phonemes and words. This makes it particularly suitable for downstream
applications such as phoneme-level analysis, speech translation, and pronunciation assessment. In summary, Whisper
provides a robust and versatile foundation for generating phoneme-level transcriptions that are used as textual input in
the proposed multimodal framework.
3.2. Unified Speech Representation Learning (UniSpeech)
The UniSpeech model Wang et al. (2021) is a transformer-based architecture developed to learn effective speech
representations for a wide range of tasks, including automatic speech recognition, language identification, and speaker
verification. By leveraging self-attention mechanisms, UniSpeech captures both local and global dependencies within
audio signals, enabling the extraction of detailed acoustic features that reflect the hierarchical structure of speech.
A major strength of UniSpeech lies in its multilingual and multitask training design. Trained on large multilingual
datasets, the model generalizes efficiently across languages and tasks, making it suitable for applications involving low-
resource or cross-lingual speech processing. Furthermore, UniSpeech incorporates unsupervised and semi-supervised
learning strategies that allow it to utilize vast amounts of unlabeled audio data, improving robustness against variability
in accents, recording conditions, and speaking styles. The use of transfer learning and knowledge distillation further
enhances its adaptability, enabling the transfer of learned knowledge from high-resource to low-resource domains.
Extensive benchmark evaluations have shown that UniSpeech achieves competitive results across various speech
processing tasks. In this study, UniSpeech embeddings are used to represent the acoustic characteristics of Arabic
phonemes, capturing subtle phonetic and prosodic features that are essential for accurate mispronunciation detection.

3.3. Contextual Language Understanding (BERT)
The BERT model Devlin et al. (2019) is a transformer-based language representation model that produces deep
contextual embeddings from textual data. Through its bidirectional self-attention mechanism, BERT captures both
semantic meaning and syntactic structure, allowing it to interpret words and phonemes in relation to their surrounding
context.
BERT is pretrained using masked language modeling and next sentence prediction objectives, enabling it to learn
general-purpose language representations from large-scale unlabeled text corpora. When fine-tuned on phoneme-level
transcriptions produced by Whisper, BERT generates context-aware textual embeddings that complement the acoustic
representations obtained from UniSpeech. These embeddings encode linguistic correctness, semantic coherence, and
phonetic consistency, supporting the identification of pronunciation errors within linguistic context.
Integrating BERT embeddings with UniSpeech acoustic features allows the proposed framework to jointly consider
linguistic and phonetic dimensions of speech. This multimodal alignment enhances the system’s capacity to detect
nuanced and context-dependent mispronunciations. Consequently, BERT serves as a reliable textual encoder within
the proposed multimodal learning framework for Arabic phoneme mispronunciation detection.
4. Proposed framework
This section presents the proposed multimodal framework designed to detect mispronunciations of Arabic
phonemes by integrating acoustic and textual information. The framework combines state-of-the-art transformer mod-
els to capture both phonetic and linguistic cues, forming a unified representation that supports accurate pronunciation
assessment. It consists of three main stages: data preprocessing and feature extraction, multimodal fusion of acoustic
and textual embeddings, and classification of phoneme-level pronunciations. The following subsections describe
the multimodal fusion strategy and the models employed in detail, including Whisper for transcription generation,
UniSpeech for acoustic representation learning, and BERT for contextual language understanding. The block diagram
of proposed method is illustrated in Fig. 1.
4.1. Dataset & Preprocessing
The dataset used in this study was adopted from the work of Çalık et al. (Calik et al., 2024). This dataset consists of
audio recordings representing the pronunciation characteristics of the Arabic alphabet and was originally constructed
using two main sources: direct recordings from Qur’anic reciters (Hafiz) and publicly available audio clips obtained
from YouTube. It contains a total of 1015 audio samples, including 232 directly recorded Arabic alphabet sounds and
783 distinct recordings collected from online sources, covering the full range of Arabic phonemes.
The raw audio data underwent a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline to ensure high performance during model
training. The initial step of this process was to remove background noise from the recordings, thereby enhancing the
audio quality. Subsequently, all audio files were standardized and unified into a common format. This standardization
included resizing each audio clip to a duration of 4 seconds and resampling to a frequency of 16 kHz.
Following the completion of the data preprocessing, two distinct datasets (Dataset A and Dataset B) are used to
evaluate the model’s performance under different scenarios. Details of these dataset setups are given in Table 1.
Two dataset configurations were designed to evaluate the model under different training–testing conditions. In
Dataset A, the 783 audio samples collected from YouTube were used for training, while the 232 recordings obtained
from Qur’anic reciters were reserved for testing, enabling the assessment of generalization on expert pronunciations.
In Dataset B, 80% of both YouTube and reciter recordings were used for training and the remaining 20% for

perspectives on model robustness and generalization capability.
4.2. Proposed Method
In this study, a multimodal framework integrating both acoustic and textual modalities is developed for the detection
of mispronunciations in Arabic phonemes. The proposed methodology consists of several stages, including feature
extraction, model design, cross-validation training, fusion strategy implementation, and performance evaluation.
For the acoustic stream, the feature encoders of the proposed Transformer models operate over a receptive field
covering approximately 400 samples (about 25 ms) of audio. Since the encoding process is conducted using signals
sampled at 16 kHz, all input audio recordings are resampled to 16 kHz during preprocessing. The audio inputs are then
padded or trimmed to a fixed duration of 4 seconds before being fed into the acoustic encoder.
A pre-trained UniSpeech Transformer model is employed to extract acoustic embeddings. For the textual modality,
all audio recordings are processed using the Whisper model, which provides phoneme-level transcriptions for each
utterance. Each audio sample is paired with its corresponding phoneme sequence and subsequently transformed into
high-dimensional embeddings using a pre-trained multilingual BERT model.
The pre-trained weights of Transformer models trained on Arabic speech data are adopted as the initial weights
in the proposed framework to improve convergence. Subsequently, each proposed model is fine-tuned using Qur’anic
recitation data, allowing it to capture pronunciation variations and phonetic characteristics unique to Qur’anic Arabic.
To prevent overfitting and to reliably assess the generalizability of the models, a five-fold cross-validation procedure
is applied to the training data of both datasets (A and B). Each training set is divided into five equal subsets, where
four subsets are used for training and one subset is used for validation in each iteration. This process ensures that
each subset serves once as a validation set, resulting in a total of five independent training–validation cycles. After
completing all cross-validation cycles, the model weights that achieve the best validation performance are selected,
and the resulting models are evaluated on the test set, which is kept completely unseen during training. This strategy
provides an objective estimation of the models’ true generalization capability.
Three fusion strategies were implemented to integrate the complementary information provided by the acoustic
and textual modalities. The architecture of the proposed deep learning-based fusion models is depicted in Figure ??.
Early Fusion: In this approach, acoustic embeddings obtained from the UniSpeech encoder and textual embeddings
extracted from the BERT model were concatenated immediately after the feature extraction stage. To ensure numerical
compatibility between the two modalities, embeddings were normalized prior to concatenation. The fused vector was
then processed by a classification network composed of multiple fully connected layers with ReLU activations and
dropout regularization. This design enabled the model to jointly capture acoustic and textual information from the
initial stage of learning, directly modeling cross-modal dependencies within the classifier.
Intermediate Fusion: In this approach, each modality was first processed independently before integration.
UniSpeech and BERT embeddings were passed through separate networks to reduce dimensionality and highlight
salient, modality-specific features. The resulting transformed embeddings were subsequently concatenated and fed
into a classifier network. This procedure allowed the model to first optimize each modality independently and then
perform multimodal integration.
Late Fusion: In this approach, the unimodal AudioOnly and TextOnly models were trained independently to
convergence. Hidden-layer embeddings from each model were extracted as modality-specific representations and
passed through layers to reduce dimensionality and emphasize the most salient features. The reduced representations
were concatenated and processed by a classification network consisting of fully connected layers with ReLU activations

and dropout regularization. During this stage, the pretrained encoder weights of UniSpeech and BERT were frozen,
ensuring that only the fusion layers were updated and the individual encoders were not retrained.
All models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score. All evaluations were conducted on the two
distinct datasets (A and B).
This methodology enables the integration of self-supervised acoustic embeddings with phoneme-level textual
embeddings through early, intermediate, and late fusion strategies, allowing robust and accurate identification of
mispronunciations in Arabic phonemes under varying recording conditions.

The training parameters for the proposed multimodal models are kept consistent across all three fusion strategies.
Each model is trained with a batch size of 8 and a learning rate of 3 × 10−5, optimized using the AdamW optimizer.
The maximum number of epochs is set to 30 for all fusion configurations.

Enhancing Quranic Learning: A Multimodal Deep Learning Approach for Arabic Phoneme Recognition
To ensure fair hyperparameter selection, a grid search–based tuning procedure is conducted on the validation set,
where candidate values for the learning rate, batch size, and dropout rate are systematically evaluated. The selected
configuration represents the best-performing combination identified through this search process.
To prevent overfitting, an early stopping mechanism is applied, which automatically terminates training when the
validation loss fails to improve for a predefined number of epochs. This approach ensures that the models converge at
the point yielding the best generalization performance without unnecessary overtraining.
The results presented in Table 2 indicate that multimodal fusion strategies applied to the UniSpeech + BERT
framework provide strong classification performance on both datasets. For Dataset A, the Early and Intermediate
Fusion strategies achieved identical top performance across all evaluation metrics (Accuracy: 0.966, F1-Score: 0.965),
demonstrating that cross-modal interactions are equally effective whether performed at the initial feature level or within
intermediate network layers. This suggests that both fusion points enable efficient exploitation of complementary
acoustic and linguistic cues.
On Dataset B, the Intermediate Fusion approach delivered the best results (Accuracy: 0.985, F1-Score: 0.985),
outperforming both Early and Late Fusion configurations. This indicates that aligning modality-specific features at a
deeper layer of the network can yield superior representations when handling more diverse and challenging samples.
Meanwhile, Early Fusion still maintains strong competitive performance, confirming its reliability as a robust and
efficient baseline fusion strategy.
Conversely, Late Fusion consistently showed the lowest performance across both datasets, highlighting that
combining independent decisions at the output stage may limit synergistic feature learning. Since high-level modality
interactions occur only after classification, this approach fails to fully leverage cross-modal relationships embedded in
the data.
Overall, these findings demonstrate that feature-level and intermediate-level fusion are more effective than decision-
level integration, and that the optimal fusion position can vary depending on dataset complexity. The results support
the conclusion that multimodal representation learning—rather than unimodal transformer processing—drives the
substantial improvements observed in downstream classification performance.
Table 3 compares the performance of the proposed multimodal fusion model with the existing transformer-based
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method.
For Dataset A, the proposed multimodal fusion model achieves an accuracy of 0.966, outperforming the
transformer-based SOTA baseline by +2.2 percentage points, alongside consistent improvements across Precision,
Recall, and F1-Score. This demonstrates that jointly modeling acoustic and linguistic information at the feature level
enriches the representational space and enhances discriminative capability beyond what a unimodal transformer can
achieve.
The improvement becomes more evident for Dataset B, where the proposed approach reaches an accuracy of 0.985
versus 0.970 with the SOTA method, reflecting a +1.5 percentage-point increase. Again, all metrics show parallel gains,
confirming that combining BERT’s contextual language understanding with UniSpeech’s speech-specific embeddings
yields a more robust and generalizable classifier across varying data conditions.
A key observation is that this advancement is achieved without increasing the complexity of a single transformer
model. Instead of scaling a unimodal transformer to deeper or more parameter-heavy configurations, the proposed
approach distributes learning across two modality-adapted transformer encoders and integrates them through an
effective fusion mechanism. This highlights that performance improvements stem from cross-modal synergy rather
than model size or architectural depth.
Overall, the findings confirm that the proposed multimodal fusion strategy offers a more accurate and efficient
alternative to purely transformer-based unimodal models.
6. Discussion
The experimental results show that the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal fusion approach, which integrates
UniSpeech-based acoustic representations and BERT-based textual embeddings to enhance speech–text classification
performance. Across both datasets, the fusion model outperformed the transformer-based state-of-the-art (SOTA)
method. This indicates that combining modality-specific representations provides complementary and more distinctive
information than relying on a single transformer architecture.
A key finding of this study is the clear benefit of cross-modal feature interaction. While transformer models
such as UniSpeech or BERT individually capture high-quality representations within their respective domains, their

unimodal nature limits the contextual richness required for robust decision-making in tasks where both speech and
linguistic context play a role. The fusion-based model mitigates this limitation by bringing together prosodic, spectral,
and semantic information, resulting in more comprehensive and expressive latent feature spaces. This synergy was
particularly evident in the substantial gains seen in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, especially on Dataset B,
where the model achieved up to a 1.5 percentage-point improvement over the SOTA baseline.
Another notable aspect is that these improvements were achieved without increasing the architectural depth or
computational burden of a single, monolithic transformer. Instead of scaling the size of the model, an approach
commonly adopted to boost performance in transformer-based systems, the proposed solution distributes learning
across two domain-optimized encoders and leverages a fusion network to integrate knowledge. This shows that, for
multimodal classification, strategic fusion design can be more impactful and efficient than increasing model complexity,
offering both performance and computational advantages. Such findings align with emerging trends in multimodal
learning, which emphasize the importance of leveraging heterogeneous cues rather than relying solely on model scaling.
In summary, the findings validate that multimodal integration of speech and text features provides a stronger
foundation for classification tasks compared to unimodal transformer models, offering enhanced accuracy, improved
robustness, and better generalization without added architectural complexity. The insights derived from this study can
guide the development of next-generation multimodal systems and encourage a shift from model-centric scaling toward
modality-centric fusion strategies.
6.1. Research Limitations
Despite its contributions, several limitations should be acknowledged to contextualize the scope of the study.
First, the datasets used for training and evaluation—although enriched with diverse samples including YouTube
recordings—remain relatively limited in scale and dialectal coverage. Arabic is characterized by significant regional
and sociolinguistic variability; thus, models trained on a restricted subset of dialects may not fully generalize to all
pronunciations or accents. Future large-scale data collection efforts are necessary to ensure broader representativeness.
Second, the speech data primarily consist of curated and relatively clean audio recordings, which may not
accurately reflect real-world acoustic conditions. Environmental noise, microphone variability, and spontaneous speech
phenomena such as hesitations and co-articulations were not extensively represented in the dataset, limiting the
framework’s robustness in uncontrolled environments.
Third, the study focused exclusively on transformer-based fusion architectures. While these models have shown
strong performance, other multi modal learning paradigms—such as convolutional-recurrent hybrids, cross-attention
networks, or graph-based fusion methods—were not explored. Additionally, model interpretability was beyond the
present study’s scope; a deeper investigation into which modality or feature subset contributes most to mispronunciation
detection could yield valuable insights for linguistic and pedagogical applications.

Finally, although the evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) provided quantitative insight into
model performance, subjective human evaluation or expert linguistic assessment was not included. Such qualitative
validation could further substantiate the model’s pedagogical effectiveness in CALL systems.
6.2. Potential Future Research
Building on these findings, several promising avenues exist for future exploration. First, expanding the dataset to
include additional speakers, genders, dialects, and recitation styles would enhance model generalization and enable
cross-dialectal robustness. Collecting spontaneous, noisy, and emotionally varied speech samples would also allow
more realistic testing of model resilience. Second, integrating real-time pronunciation feedback mechanisms into
the multimodal framework could transform it into an interactive CALL tool. Embedding the model within mobile
or web-based platforms would allow learners to receive immediate, context-aware feedback on pronunciation errors,
potentially accelerating learning outcomes and improving retention. Third, future studies may investigate adaptive and
personalized learning mechanisms using reinforcement learning or speaker embedding techniques, enabling the system
to tailor feedback based on the learner’s proficiency and progress. Such approaches could bridge the gap between
automatic assessment and individualized pedagogy. Fourth, exploring cross-lingual and multilingual multimodal
fusion could extend this methodology to other morphologically rich or phonemically intricate languages, such as
Persian, Urdu, or Turkish. Comparative studies across languages may also reveal universal patterns in multimodal
phoneme learning.
Moreover, incorporating prosodic, articulatory, and visual cues—for instance, through lip-reading data or
spectrogram-based articulatory feature modeling—could provide a more holistic understanding of pronunciation and
articulation. Finally, a potential future direction involves combining multimodal transformers with self-supervised
pretraining on large multilingual corpora, enhancing both transferability and efficiency in low-resource contexts. Col-
lectively, these directions underscore that the present research not only advances the state of Arabic mispronunciation
detection but also establishes a generalizable paradigm for multimodal speech assessment, bridging the gap between
linguistic theory, machine learning, and educational technology.
